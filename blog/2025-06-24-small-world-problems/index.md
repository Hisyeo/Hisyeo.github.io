Many new developments in the realm of building this language and culture and
a good chunk of it revolvees around Umberto Eco's concept of The Small World.

<!-- truncate -->

## Small Updates

First, let's discuss the smaller changes that have been added recently to the
site. The [occupation and arrangements](/docs/lessons/occupation-arrangements)
lesson has been added with many compounds that can be used for various jobs and
life arrangements.

:::info Ephemeral Compounds

Remember that Hîsyêô is a living language and the compounds are never set in
stone, if a better compound is found through the Kennings project, feel free to
submit an issue ticket or (better yet) a pull request to have it updated in any
materials on this site. Regardless of what the site shows, you are always free
to use your own compounds that make sense to you and who you are speaking to.

:::

Additionally, the translation of [The Wicked Prince](/docs/works/wicked-prince)
was completed, [various](/docs/lessons/first-steps#pronunciation)
[improvements](/docs/language/phonology) were made to the phonology details
around the site, a [punctuation](/docs/language/punctuation) reference page has
been added, the [first](/docs/scripts/000-creator_notes)
[two](/docs/scripts/001-fîectu) scripts for the comprehensible input course
have been written, and several word changes have been made.

## Word Changes

### cereal
Changed from lîsîk (Arabic رِزْق riziki, /rizik/, Afro-Asiatic family) to kûkmut
(Cantonese 穀物 guk1 mat6, /kuk.mɐt̚/, Sino-Tibetan family) due to concerns with
recognizability of transliteration and the need to increase Sino-Tibetan family
representation.

### rice
Removed the word for "rice", onomû (Telugu అన్నము annamu, /an̪n̪amu/, Dravidian
family), because it is a kind of grain and is too specific for the language. We
will revisit this when there is more work done on recipe translations.

### sweet
The transliteration for "sweet" is from the English word /swit/ and to better
match the use of /w/, the consonant-/w/ is removed and replaced with a
vowel-/u/: sûît. Due to the tedency to glide consecutive vowels, this sounds
much closer to the English source.

### excess
The transliteration for "excess" was improved: odigon (Tamil அதிகம் atikam,
/ad̪iɡam/, Dravidian family). Likely this was just missed from an earlier
phonology change.

### art
The transliteration for "art" was improved to reflect the phonetics better:
kolowu (Sinhalese කලාව kalāwa, [kalaːwə], Indo-Iranian family). This could even
be taken a step further by changing the first /o/ to a /ʌ/ which would force the
second syllable to become stressed (helping to reinforce the long vowel /ː/),
but we have not yet pulled the plug on this change. Reach out if you think this
is appropriate.

### reptile
The transliteration for "reptile" was improved to reflect the available phonemic
information in the latin orthography (no phonetic pronunciation available):
bûlûsî (Chichewa buluzi, Niger-Congo family). I suspect that this one was just
missed from voicing shift from /p/ to /b/ that was done a long time ago ([d] and
related phonetic sounds were going to /b/ to emphasize their voiced feature).

### Preposition grammatical terminology
The thematic constituent markers were updated to reflect more accurate
linguistic terminology.

- beneficiary/purpose → causal-final
- collaborator → comitative
- evidence → evidential
- experiencere/causee → causal-agentive
- agent/causer → agentive
- location/time → locative
- intermediate → intermediative
- instrument/means → instrumental
- manner/material → methodological
- source/origin → ablative
- counter-agent → oppositive
- direction/recipient → dative
- reason/cause → causal
- distance/duration → durative

### tolerant
The pinyin page on Wikipedia indicates that the "r" in the pinyin
[kuānróng](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ku%C4%81nr%C3%B3ng) is realized as [ɻ]
~ [ʐ]. It also indicates that Taipai Mandarin speakers would pronounce it as
[ɹ]. This tendency towards the rhotics leads me to believe that this should use
the /l/ in Hîsyêô instead of the /ʃ/: kûonlôn (Mandarin 寬容kuānróng,
[kʰwan.ɻʊŋ], Sino-Tibetan family).

### sighing
To describe the concept of "sighing" in a comfortable way is difficult in the
current lexicon. This concept has a very distinct description involving a sound,
a bodily action and air. It also has a multi-faceted set of deeper meanings and
feelings associated with it: tôncoî (Thai ถอนใจ tɔ̌ɔn-jai, /tʰɔːn˩˩˦.t͡ɕaj˧/,
Kra-Dai family).

### rotten/corrupt
Both this concept and "sighing" above, were discovered as problems when
translating The Wicked Prince. There is not a satisfactory way to describe this
that doesn't overlaod other concepts. There does seem to be an overwhelming
number of languages that combine the concepts of "rotten" and "corrupt" into one
word and so we will do the same here: mîstu (Kanuri mìstə́, /mistə/,
Nilo-Saharan family).

### frequent
Another concept discovered during translation, this one was traditionally
(Kokanu) done using the concepts "ongoing", "repeating", or "many times".
However, there is significant difference between these concepts and "frequent".
Also, if you integrate the concept of "recurring" and also use this adverbially
to represent habitual mood, one can see the utility presented: ogogê (Kannada
ಆಗಾಗ್ಗೆ āgāgge, /aː.gaː.gːe/, Dravidian family).

### easy/simple & difficult/complex
Previously (from the Kokanu days), Hîsyêô had the same conjoined concept of
"easy" with "simple" and "difficult" with "complex". But one set of concepts is
about a challenge or task and the other is about a thought or a concept. In
fact, a task can be "simple" but also be "difficult" and this distinction feels
erased when you combine these concepts.
- **simple/basic:** fîectu (Albanian thjeshtë, /ˈθjɛʃtə/, Albania family)
- **complex/complicated:** fonfûk (Cantonese 繁複 faan4 fuk1, Sino-Tibetan family)
- **easy/effortless:** obunyun (Sora apəŋjəŋ, [apəŋjəŋ], Austro-Asiatic family)
- **difficult/challenging:** kutin (Hindi कठिन kaṭhin, [kə.ʈʰɪ̃n̪], Indo-Iranian family)

### awkward & dexterous
A pair of opposing adjectives were added that were difficult to express with the
existing lexicon.
- **awkward/clumsy:** sokol (Turkish sakar, Turkic family)
- **dexterous/skillful:** kîyô (Japonese きよう kiyō, [kʲijo̞ː], Japonic family)

### violet
The source word for "violet", when transliterated, had the ending syllable of
"xe" which conflicts with the subjective subordinate marker and could
potentially lead to confusion and is also overly repetitive when spoken.
Ironically, the new source word when transliterated is only a small vowel shift
away but the problem is still eliminated and easy to clear up if needed: bonôxo
(Urmia ܒܵܢܲܦ̮ܫܵܐ bānafšā, [bɑːnoːʃɑː], Afro-Asiatic family).

## Discord Bot & Kennings

Unfortunately, the platform Glitch that we were using for the Discord bot and
Kennings is [shutting
down](https://blog.glitch.com/post/changes-are-coming-to-glitch/) on July 8th. A
rewrite is coming that will also make the suite usable in the Matrix space and
we are thinking about either [Deno](https://deno.com/deploy) or
[Fly.io](https://fly.io). Please reachout if you have any ideas or want to
contribute.

## The Small World

Now time for the *big* update that's been brewing for the past few months now as
studies have continued around various topics related to semantics, pragmatics,
and translation.

In Umberto Eco's book *The Limits of Intepretation*, he discusses the concept of
small worlds to illustrate how the writer of a text creates an incomplete set of
facts which are presented in the text. He says that:

> [...] fictional worlds are parasitical worlds because, if alternative
> properties are not spelled out, we take for granted the properties holding in
> the real world (p. 75)

This property of fictional worlds also holds for fictional languages. By that, I
mean *all* constructed languages—whether for fun or for a purpose. If the exact
meaning of "pissed" is not explained, one might inadvertently use the wrong
sense or might revert to their sense of that term from their native language.
Not only that, writers often expect their readers to have a specific backgrounds
to understand something critically and identify satire and allegory and this
would be doubly difficult when intepretation requires translating into compounds
more often than not (as it does in Hîsyêô). Fictional worlds *within* fictional
languages could be considered the worst possible scenario for a model reader to
derive proper understanding from a text.

If language is what a culture thinks (Boris Erasov, Yogendra Singh), and the
culture of this language is incomplete, then the properties that aren't spelled
out will be pulled from the cultures that the speakers have already. Unless you
somehow can carefully select the speakers of your language or police their every
expression, you will never have a true culture of your own but rather a
parasitic franken-culture made up of the cultures of your speaker community. In
fact, the very act of restrictive control in this manner is antithetical to this
project as a whole.

Therefore, instead of an imperative and suppressive approach, the creators of
Hîsyêô have determined that this language needs a culture of its own. One that
is inspired by world religions and world philosophies. One that we can point to
and showcase and demonstrate so that others might join us. If anyone feels the
need to return to their culture of yore, they are more than welcome to do so but
it will be considered an act of secession from the community and we'll welcome
them back when they return.

## A New Religion

Since religion shapes cultural practices (and with the influence of Nietzsche
and his desire for a fusional return to the Greek pantheon), a new polytheistic
religion has been created which has an egalitarian system of morality, cultural
scripts for personal and community development, a satisfying mythology of
monumental proportions, and a kind of quixotic logic which both harnesses and
emboldens the human spirit.

> Monotheistic religions alone furnish the spectacle of religious wars,
> religious persecutions, heretical tribunals, that breaking of idols and
> destruction of images of the gods, that razing of Indian temples and Egyptian
> colossi, which had looked on the sun 3,000 years: just because a jealous god
> had said, Thou shalt make no graven image. -Schopenhauer, [Religion: A Dialogue](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10833/10833-h/10833-h.htm#RULE4_2)

This religion might seem provocative but without it, there is a spiritual and
metaphysical gap in the fabric of the cultural worldview (and thus a gap in the
language). It's a part of *all* societies and should be understood and harnessed
for *good* instead of being despised or following antequarian religions that do
not align with modern world views. If you've had negative experiences with
religions in your native society or colonizer's society, please understand that
this religion was purpose-built to be a reflection of the best traits of
humanity. Hopefully you can find something to love here or at least see it as a
positive allegory for the human condition.

## A New Social Order

Alongside the religion, there is an effort to build a social order around the
ideas of [Participatory
Economics](https://participatoryeconomy.org/the-model/overview/) and
[Parpolity](https://znetwork.org/znetarticle/parpolity-political-vision-for-a-good-society-by-stephen1-shalom).
While we cannot put these ideas into direct practice at this time, we feel that
language, religion and social order are deeply interconnected and the dark
practices of greed and machiavellianism might infect the whole project if these
cornerstones are ill-defined.

## Publication & Next Steps

Over the last couple weeks, many discussions have been had and materials
created. Today, this content is now available all across the site. It was
important that there was a semblance of good content to begin this phase of the
project so that the meaning and significance of the project could be illustrated
in the expansiveness and depth available. More content is planned and will be
coming as additional details are determined and written.
