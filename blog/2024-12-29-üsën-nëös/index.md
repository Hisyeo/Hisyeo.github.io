The new year is almost here. I am excited to keep growing the learning materials
here on this site and eventually also making some lesson videos. I want 2025 to
be the Year of Hisyëö.

We did a lot in 2024 and I'd like to take a minute to reflect on some of the
accomplishments:

- Added many pages in the reference guide. The site is now at a point where
  everything should have at least some coverage somewhere. You could fully learn
  the language now by using this site.
- Added tons of added details to the lessons which help give many common
  sentences and important topics when navigating the world with this language as
  your primary communicative toolbox.
- Finished all of the Shannon Test Sentences and The North Wind and The Sun
  fable.
- Translated over 50% of the children's story A Poor Count's Christmas.
- Maintained flashcards on Memrise and now Deckademy with all the many updates
  to the phonology and lexicon along the way.
- Finished the language in the sense that the grammar is now set in stone and
  the lexicon is robust enough to handle the translating I've done so far.
- Completed an abugida and implemented a font that properly kerns the various
  abugida characters
- Designed a featural syllabary that has symbols for all possible Hisyëö
  phonemes and am about 30% complete on implementing all the SVGs in FontForge

That's quite a bit of work and it's just the first real year of Hisyëö
development. For 2025, we plan to do so much more:

- Finish translating A Poor Count's Christmas
- Finish the syllabary and add it to the site
- Finish the remaining written lessons
- Write and record the first set of video story lessons.
- Translate another work of literature.
- Write a series of blog posts about printmaking of the syllabary.

I hope you stick around, check out the content and learn this language in the
new year.

Wishing you all the best ahead,

Team Hisyëö
