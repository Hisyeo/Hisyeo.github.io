# Sentences

The structure of morphemes, phrases and sentence constituents.

## Morphosyntactics

Hîsyêô is considered an [isolating
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language) because all words
are a single morpheme. Some examples of isolating languages are
[Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language#Grammar),
[Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_grammar), and
[Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language#Grammar).

:::info What Is A Morpheme?

A [morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme) is a single unit of
meaning. In English, the word "cat" is a single morpheme but the word "cats" is
two morphemes: "cat" + "s" where the "s" is the morpheme that signifies that a
noun is plural. The word "intwined" is three morphemes, "in" for the meaning of
*interconnectedness*, "twine" for the verb that means to wrap or weave with a
twine-like object, and "ed" for the past participle of the verb (the modifier
form in past tense).

:::

Hîsyêô is also considered an [analytic
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_language), which means that
prepositions, particles and modifiers (grammatical relations) are separate words
that provide the additional meaning to words (instead of inflection or affixes
that are used in [synthetic
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_language)). English is mostly
an analytic language although there are some instances of affixes (such as
"-ed", "-ing", "-s"). There are no prefixes nor affixes in Hîsyêô, all meaning
is provided via separate words in known as prepositions and particles.

### Constituent Word Order

The order with which you setup a clause or sentence is called [constituent
order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_order#Constituent_word_orders).
Sentences are made up of verb and noun phrases that exist within prepositional
phrases. Let's ignore what prepositional phrases are available for the time
being and just zoom out and think about subject phrases (with noun phrases
within), action phrases (with verb phrases within), and thematic phrases (with
noun phrases within). Many languages require that you order your sentence in a
particular way such that each element along the way can be understood as a
paritcular part of the sentence. Some of the most prevalent constituent orders
that occur in natural languages include:
[subject-object-verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb_word_order),
[subject-verb-object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order),
[verb-second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V2_word_order), and
[topic-comment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_and_comment). In addition to
these sentence structure types, there also exists some languages that have no
strict word order. Instead they use morphological elements to identify the
different parts of the sentence. In these languages, the order in which the
parts of a sentence are provided may indicate the theme or theme of a sentence
as well.

Hîsyêô has a mostly free constituent order because all sentence parts are marked
by a preposition. The order of your sentence puts the first provided element as
the topic and each successive constituent as comments about the topic in order
of importance. That said, there are three irregularities that reduce the freedom
slightly. 

#### Irregularity #1: First Constituent Agent Elision

If the first constituent of a sentence is the agent, the marker (HisyeoWord is='û'/>) can
be elided (skipped) and the noun phrase provided unmarked. Because of this
elision rule, sentence structure does lean towards a preference of
[subject-verb-object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order).

If the agent's nucleus is a base verb, unfortunately, it must be preceded by the
marker so that it's clear that you are referring to the noun derivation of that
verb.

#### Irregularity #2: Verb-Object Syntactic Alignment

Direct objects are always introduced by a verb. There is no way to provide a
direct object before providing the verb. Additionally, you can't follow a verb
immediately with another verb phrase (just like you can't immediately follow any
other thematic relation by another thematic relation).

#### Irregularity #3: Verb-Connector Syntactic Alignment

If a verb is preceded by a connector, it is interpreted as the noun derivation.
Only when followed by a thematic relation marker does the connector signify a
new sentence. This means that there's some difficulty when expressing compound
sentences that hinge on a change in verb but there are ways around it.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû fôlun xe dênêmêk kon xobo yodo kon bôkôfoc ko.&emsp;<em>"Do you want to practice hitting or blocking?"</em></p>
    <p>nîo buswen mokon yodo îskô ko.&emsp;<em>"Do they need food or drink?"</em>&emsp;<small>(Instead of "Do they need to eat or to drink?")</small></p>
    <p>mênyûu onô bi ôhêl bi môcîbo kelo kelo kôto kôto hoî bitûn mûlû. &emsp;<em>"The kids were playing and talking all night."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Null Constituents

When an independent clause lacks a constituent like an agent/causer or
patient/causee, such a clause is said to have a **null subject**. This means
that the subject can be inferred through the surrounding sentence, prior
sentences or any other contextual cues.

When an indendent clause lacks a verbal constituent but contains a subject
constituent and other thematic constituents,the clause is said to have a **null
copula**. This means that the relationship between the subject and the thematic
constituents can be inferred through the surrounding sentence, prior sentences
or any other contextual cues.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû (li gô) hoî ulyô ko.&emsp;<em>Are you there?</em></p>
    <p>(noyo) (li gô) hoî ôfo.&emsp;<em>I am here.</em></p>
    <p>(nîmû) (li gô) hoî zik?&emsp;<em>Where are you?</em></p>
    <p>(noyo) (li gô) bi cônkôk hoî ôfo.&emsp;<em>Right here.</em></p>
    <p>(nîmû) (li gô) oxon zik dên noyo?&emsp;<em>Why are you against me?</em></p>
    <p>(noyo) (li gô) nênko fos noyo kôî li gô (misli ulyô).&emsp;<em>Because I can be.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

In the last sentence, the subordinate clause inside of the <HisyeoWord is='nênko'/> preposition
phrase could not have its verb elided because we needed to apply the epistemic verb particle.

### Phrase Word Order

Each constituent has a marker and a phrase (either an adverb or a noun).
Within any given phrase there is always one word that is the main contents of
that phrase. This is known as the
[nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(linguistics)) of the phrase. In
some languages the nucleus is the *first* word and in other languages the nucleus
is the *last* word in a phrase. The nucleus of an action phrase is a verb, the
nucleus of a subject or semantic phrase is a noun. Hîsyêô has a nucleus in the
middle of a phrase (it *is* a nucleus, after all). Determiners go to the *left*
of the nucleus and modifiers to the *right*.

## Sentence Types

### Simple

A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause with no dependent
clauses.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo mokon sî yoûtî kûôxi.&emsp;<em>He ate some fruit.</em></p>
    <p>û oûtô gîsgûl onô li kobût.&emsp;<em>The bicycle is broken.</em></p>
    <p>hoî lono mîhûon û noyo cînlî sî dênêmêk kîôsô noyo.&emsp;<em>On Wednesday, I had my athletic exam.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Compound

A compound sentence consists of multiple independent clauses with no dependent
clauses. These clauses are joined together using conjunctions.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo îskô sî yoûtî xîmu lêkin bi môcîbo fôlun xe îskô eswen.&emsp;<em>He drank some water but was still thirsty.</em></p>

</HisyeoTabs>

### Complex

A complex sentence consists of one independent clause and at least one dependent
clause.

    <p>hôn fos nîmû li nô, kûu xokûlû noyo lôtfen.&emsp;<em>If you go, please call me.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Compound-Complex

A compound–complex sentence (or complex–compound sentence) consists of multiple
independent clauses, at least one of which has at least one dependent clause.

<HisyeoTabs>
