- For all phonemes, there is some flexibility in the position, voicing, aspiration, etc. to accommodate learners who speak languages that may pronounce these sounds differently
- Words beginning with a vowel can begin with or without a glottal stop [ʔ] pronounced, at the discretion of the speaker.
- The coda-/n/ can be realized as (1) nasalization of the preceding vowel, (2) it can assimilate to the position of the following sound, i.e. /n/ → [m, n, ɲ, ŋ, ɴ] based on the position of the following or (3) coda-/n/ is pronounced [n] in all places.
- The coda-/k/ is often realized without any audible release [k̚]
- However, when coda-/k/ is preceding /y/ or /w/ then it is realized as a back fricative [x]
- The coda-/t/ is often realized without any audible release [t̚]
- However, when coda-/t/ is preceding /y/ or /w/ then it is realized with aspiration [tʰ]
- The coda-/s/ is often realized as [z] in word final position
- The /h/ is often realized as [ç] when preceding /i/ or /u/ vowels.


### Vowels

| Hisyëö  | Latin | IPA | Transliteration Sources                             |
| :-----: | :---: | --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
|         | ⟨o⟩ | /ɑ/ | open-back unrounded vowels: a ɑ ɐ                        |
| ⟨ ı ⟩ | ⟨ö⟩ | /ɔ/ | open-back-close-back rounded vowels: ɶ ɒ ɞ ɔ o ɵ               |
| ⟨ ʄ ⟩ | ⟨ü⟩ | /u/ | back close vowels: u ʉ ʊ ɯ                          |
| ⟨ ȷ ⟩ | ⟨ı⟩ | /ɪ/ | central near-close-mid vowels: ɪ ʏ ɨ ɘ       |
| ⟨ ɟ ⟩ | ⟨i⟩ | /i/ | front close vowels: i y                     |
| ⟨ ɿ ⟩ | ⟨e⟩ | /ɛ/ | front/central unrounded near-open-mid vowels: ɛ ɜ æ |
| ⟨ ʇ ⟩ | ⟨ë⟩ | /e/ | front close-mid vowels: e ø                         |

## Phonotactics

Syllable structure is (C)V(C) where only these codas are allowed:
- /k/
- /t/
- / t͡ɕ/
- /s/
- /n/
- /l/

All codas cannot be followed by their same phoneme as the onset of the next
syllable. There are also some additional instances where certain onsets are not
allowed following certain codas:
- coda-/k/ cannot be followed by onset-/g/
- coda-/t/ cannot be followed by onset-/d/ or onset-/ʃ/
- coda-/ t͡ɕ/ cannot be followed by onset-/s/
- coda-/s/ cannot be followed by onset-/ʃ/
- onset-/h/ cannot exist after any coda

Strong vowels are slightly geminated compared to the weak vowels:

|         |               Strong               |        Weak         |
| ------- | :--------------------------------: | :-----------------: |
| Abugida | (null), ⟨ı⟩, ⟨ʄ⟩, ⟨ɟ⟩, ⟨ʇ⟩ | ⟨ʃ⟩, ⟨ȷ⟩, ⟨ɿ⟩ |
| Latin   | ⟨o⟩, ⟨ö⟩, ⟨ü⟩, ⟨i⟩, ⟨ë⟩  | ⟨u⟩, ⟨ı⟩, ⟨e⟩ |

## Prosody

Emphasis is a slight pitch prominence and increased loudness. Length is only
influenced by vowel strength. In two syllable words, the stress is placed on the
first syllable regardless of the vowels present. In three syllable words, stress
is placed on the second syllable if the first vowel is weak and the second
syllable is strong.

Either an unvoiced pause or a voiced clause ender are used to mark the ending of
a ta- or te-clause. Sentence endings are also just slightly longer pauses and/or
sentence ender particles.

## Word restrictions

All of the dictionary words of Hisyëö (not including proper nouns or loanwords,
etc.) are either one-, two- or three-syllables long. There are no minimal pairs
that contrast using any “conflicting phonemes”.

### Consonant Conflicts
- /b/ with /f/ and /d/
- /k/ with /h/ and /g/
- /g/ with /h/, /k/, and /d/
- /t/ with /d/, / t͡ɕ/, /s/, and /n/
- / t͡ɕ/ with /d͡ʒ/, /t/
- /d/ with /t/, /g/, /d͡ʒ/, and /b/
- /d͡ʒ/ with / t͡ɕ/ and /d/
- /s/ with /f/, / t͡ɕ/, and /t/
- /x/ with /s/ and /f/, and / t͡ɕ/
- /f/ with /s/, /x/, /b/, and /w/
- /h/ with Ø, /k/, and /g/
- /m/ with /n/
- /n/ with /m/
- Ø (null onset) with /h/, /k/, and /g/
- /w/ with Ø, /f/, and /l/
- /l/ with /j/ and /w/
- /j/ with Ø and /l/

### Vowel Conflicts
- /ɑ/ with /ə/ and /ı/           
- /æ/ with /ı/ and /ə/    
- /ı/ with /ɑ/, /i/, and /e/
- /ə/ with /ɑ/, /ɔ/, and /æ/
- /ɔ/ with /u/ and /ə/
- /e/ with /ı/ and /i/
- /i/ with /e/ and /ı/
- /u/ with /ɔ/

This means that two words that differ by one sound cannot have any of these conflicting phonemes as the differing sounds. For example, since %%yöcno@yöcno%% is a Hisyëö word, there are no words like yözmo, yözto or özno also in the language because they differ by one phoneme that conflicts with a phoneme in %%yöcno@yöcno%%.
