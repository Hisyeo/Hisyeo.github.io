# Verbs

A type of word that represents an action. Each sentence will always have a verb
phrase. Verbs are considered a "semi-preposition" because when not proceded by
certain particles, they act just like a preposition introducing a noun phrase
(the direct object of the verb). If you supply the verb before the subject,
nothing changes about the verb phrase (although the subject now must be
introduced with either <HisyeoWord is='ü'/> or <HisyeoWord is='ölë'/>).

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo mokon küöxı.&emsp;<em>"I ate a fruit."</em></p>
    <p>mokon küöxı ü noyo.&emsp;<em>"A fruit was eaten by me."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::caution Passivity

Hisyëö doesn't actually have any form of passivity like in the second English
sentence above. Verbs always introduce their object arguments. To simulate
passivity you can:
- place the verb phrase before the subject phrase,
- use a relative clause on an object in a subject complement phrase, or
- use the causative verb particle on a subject complement phrase.

The order of topicality is determined by the order that constituents are
introduced into the sentence.

## Prepositions

### Realis

The most basic form of verbal preposition is the realis form. There is no
prepositional particle when this form is used. When there is no particle
attached to the verb, it means that it is a true (or believed to be true)
statement of an action or state that is occurring or is being experienced *in
reality*. These predicates can be in the past, present or future tense but they
are usually considered to be imperfective and not perfect (since there is a
particle that can specify that the action is perfect).

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hoi woküt zık ü nü mokon hoi bıtün cokyen öfo.&emsp;<em>What time are we eating this evening?</em></p>
    <p>fonolon lunsol ibüwë müt noyo.&emsp;<em>The monkey is throwing rocks at me.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Irrealis

There are a few different irrealis verb markers that allow for a variety of
different moods indicating that the predicate has not occurred (or isn't known
to have). They precede the verb and are considered prepositions.

#### Epistemic (*what could be*)

This irrealis verb marker (<HisyeoWord is='köi'/>) indicates that the predicate
*can*, *could*, *may*, or *might* happen. This marker tells you that the speaker/writer either
believes or has knowledge that the predicate may occur but isn't confident that
this future reality is assured or that the possibility of it occurring doesn't
necessitate that it will be. It can also be used in past tense to mean that the
possibility of it occurring in the past was likely or that there is knowledge
that the subject was definitely capable of completing the action. When used to
frame the predicate of a question, it has the effect of asking for permission.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hoi ılık fos noyo lı dës dëko, ü noyo köi dëko bı xön ëto.&emsp;<em>Before I was blind, I could see very well.</em></p>
    <p>noyo goniso fos niün köi tüu nı hön fos niün fölun bı hokiki.&emsp;<em>I think he could do it if he really wanted to.</em></p>
    <p>noyo xiwon xe köi lı xikö ze.&emsp;<em>I wish I could fly!</em></p>
    <p>noyo köi yön öntön tetëk mulö bı ilxizuk ko.&emsp;<em>Could I borrow your coat?</em></p>
    <p>noyo köi sıtyo hoı ulyö ko.&emsp;<em>May I sit there?</em></p>

    <p>nü köi buswen fın xe lı len eswen yoüti ci.&emsp;<em>Yeah, I think we might need something a bit sturdier.</em></p>

    <p>niün köi köto tö hiskünco Ingulıc, Vulonsë, ün Döic.&emsp;<em>She can speak English, French, and German.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Conditional (*what would be*)

The conditional verb marker (<HisyeoWord is='bit'/>) indicates that the
predicate occurring is dependent on some other circumstance that is either
explicitly described or implied.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hoi lono kut yë boxö kon bëüdo ü noyo monodo umo wohi xe bit di hünsüon noyo.&emsp;<em>On my first day at University, I met the woman who would become my wife.</em></p>
    <p>hön fos noyo lı bilüs hoi xe köntësto oxon yoküntik, ü noyo bit cüdo fun düi muni müt küngiyo yöüli.&emsp;<em>If I won the lottery, I would give half the money to charity.</em></p>
    <p>noyo bit yübik xe lı lö monodo.&emsp;<em>I would love to come and visit.</em></p>
    <p>küu dëko biek süwit yë sobölë xön ëto ze. noyo bit mokon möi ulyö bı mülü ze.&emsp;<em>Look at that yummy cake! I would eat that all up!</em></p>
    <p>noyo müt nimü bit sölü xe sityo bı koli.&emsp;<em>I would ask you all to sit down.</em></p>
    <p>noyo müt goniso fos niün lı si cok bı ılık.&emsp;<em>I would imagine that they have already left.</em></p>
    <p>niün lı köxentë yë mefüs oxon fos niün bit bunyentoc si xe besol zınkon.&emsp;<em>He's very security-conscious, so he would have remembered to lock the door.</em></p>
    <p>niün bit lı gö hoi sınsi Lundun bı ibüdü cokyen.&emsp;<em>They would be arriving in London round about now.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::info The different conditional classifications of English

In English, conditionals are broken down into types known as zero conditional,
first conditional (or conditional I), second conditional (or conditional II),
third conditional (or conditiona III), and mixed conditional. These different
types are created with different tenses and auxiliaries in English and a similar
differentiation of syntax occurs in Hisyëö.

- **Zero conditional**: These conditionals are sentences that express a factual
  implication instead of a hypothetical or potential future circumstance. They
  do not use the conditional verb marker and either utilize the context marker (<HisyeoWord is='hön'/>)
  or the time marker (<HisyeoWord is='hoi'/>) to indicate the condition.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hön fos gongoxi öitun, lı mötö hoi boxö yë limien ilë.&emsp;<em>If the alarm goes off, there's a fire somewhere in the building.</em></p>
    <p>hön fos nimü lı ëo foüt, umo fısun ëo ölë nimü.&emsp;<em>If you make a mistake, someone lets you know.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

- **First conditional**: These conditionals are sentences thot regard the
  consequences of a probable **future** event. They also do not use the
  conditional verb marker and utilize the context marker (<HisyeoWord
  is='hön'/>) or the time marker (<HisyeoWord is='hoi'/>) to indicate the
  condition. The difference from Zero conditional sentences is the use of future
  tense in the consequence. You can also use the perfective marker (<HisyeoWord
  is='si'/>) or an imperative (<HisyeoWord is='küu'/>) on the consequence.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hön fos niün sölü müt noyo, noyo ke fohoso bësnëhot niün bı diyondë ëto.&emsp;<em>If he asks me, I will consider his proposal carefully.</em></p>
    <p>hön fos nimü lı ëo foüt, umo ke fısun ëo ölë nimü.&emsp;<em>If you make a mistake, someone will let you know.</em></p>
    <p>hoi hüzon yë lono mutyu cıhöü küu lı lö müt boxö noyo.&emsp;<em>If it rains this afternoon, come round to my place!</em></p>
    <p>hön fos nimü lı cok ibüdü, nimü ke monodo&emsp;<em>If you leave now, you will still catch your train.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

- **Second conditional**: These conditionals are sentences used to describe
  hypothetical, and typically counterfactual, situations in the **present** or
  **future** tense.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hön fos noyo süko köndodü, ü noyo bit lı gö hoi eswen niün.&emsp;<em>If I liked parties, I would attend more of them.</em></p>
    <p>hön fos lı hüzon hoi lono uklo, ü umo bit lı cıfulo hoi titon.&emsp;<em>If it rained tomorrow, people would dance in the street.</em></p>
    <p>hön fos nimü lı cok bı ibüdü, ü nimü bı gufıs bit doicël oütö kiskö nimü.&emsp;<em>If you left now, you would still catch your train.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

- **Third conditional**: These conditionals are sentences used to describe
  hypothetical, and typically counterfactual, situations in the **past** tense.
  The condition clause is in the past perfect and the consequence is in
  conditional perfect.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hön fos nimü xokülü si noyo, ü noyo bit lı si lö.&emsp;<em>If you had called me, I would have come.</em></p>
    <p>niün bit lı si bilüs hön fos noyo lı si yöüli müt niün.&emsp;<em>Would he have succeeded if I had helped him?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

- **Mixed conditional**: These conditionals are a mixture of the second and
  third classifications. Either the condition or the consequence, but not both,
  has a past time reference. When the condition refers to the past, but the
  consequence to the present, the condition clause is in the past perfect (as
  with the Third conditional), while the main clause is in the conditional mood
  (as in the Second conditional). When the consequence refers to the past, but
  the condition is not expressed as being limited to the past, the condition
  clause is expressed as in the second conditional (past, but not past perfect),
  while the main clause is in the conditional perfect (as in the third
  conditional).

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hön fos nimü tüu si wëloı bı dündon, nü bit yünyoü yök ixölö öfo bı ibüdü.&emsp;<em>If you had done your job properly, we wouldn't be in this mess now.</em></p>
    <p>hön fos noyo lı si ëo hünsüon ölë umo Keli, noyo bit niwos yök hoi küöcyo Elvu bı ibüdü.&emsp;<em>If I hadn't married Kelly, I wouldn't be living in Scotland now.</em></p>
    <p>hön fos nü lı umo güexo bı ılik, nü bit tüu si yök nı mıslı ulyö.&emsp;<em>If we were soldiers, we wouldn't have done it like that.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

#### Deontic (*what should be*)

To indicate that something should be or ought to be, you would use the deontic
verb marker (<HisyeoWord is='küu'/>). It indicates that the true state of things
(realis) doesn't match what the speaker expects, believes or desires. A sentence
with the deontic verb marker generally indicates what action could be taken to
rectify the state of things.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo küu lı yöüli müt nimü.&emsp;<em>I ought to help you.</em></p>
    <p>nü küu lı lö ze.&emsp;<em>Let's go!</em></p>
    <p>küu gomi oksün ulyö.&emsp;<em>Don't take that meat.</em></p>
    <p>ü yübik noyo küu lı gö ofek nimü lötfen.&emsp;<em>May my love be with you.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


### Future

There is a form of verbal preposition that is on a slightly different dimension
from the realis/irrealis verb markers above. Instead of delineating the mood of
the sentence, this marker indicates that the predicate will occur in the future.
This marker (<HisyeoWord is='ke'/>) indicates what linguists call the **future
tense**.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>umo Zon ke lı cok hoı bıtün öfo.&emsp;<em>John is going to leave tonight.</em></p>
    <p>noyo ke golo tömös onö.&emsp;<em>I will/shall read the book</em></p>
    <p>nü küu fohoso ulyö, nü ke tüu ko. &emsp;<em>Let us examine that, shall we?</em></p>
    <p>kut yë umo kölmüdul ke monodo nimü hoi lono uklo.&emsp;<em>One of our salesmen will visit you tomorrow.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## From...

Converting from the other content types into verbs isn't possible.

### Nouns

A noun cannot act as a verb, it must be provided with the subject complement
marker (<HisyeoWord is='lı'/>). This is called a **noun complement**. The subject is being described as
being some noun. This has the effect of meaning "is a [noun]" in English.


### Modifiers

A modifier cannot act as a verb, it must be provided with the subject complement
marker (<HisyeoWord is='lı'/>). This is called a **modifier complement**. The
subject is being described as being some modifier (in some state). This has the
effect of meaning "is [adjective]" in English.

## Verb Modifiers

There are three **verb modifiers** that can be mixed-and-matched in a verb
phrase. They always follow the verb itself (not the verb marker) and they
precede the direct object. The verb marker and the set of verb modifiers circumfix the
verb.

### Negatitive

The negatitive verb modifier (<HisyeoWord is='yök'/>) turns the verb phrase
into the negated version of itself. In English, this is the "not" adverb.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hön xe yök züyı ozüul yonlüs, noyo lı si lö bı föhon.&emsp;<em>Not knowing any better, I went ahead.</em></p>
    <p>nimü buswen yök xe xontün cızi.&emsp;<em>You don’t need to trouble yourself.</em></p>
    <p>mötifö yöcno lı yök xe funsüt.&emsp;<em>The objective is not to lose.</em></p>
    <p>küu tüu yök ulyö.&emsp;<em>Don't do that.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Causative

The causative verb modifier (<HisyeoWord is='ëo'/>) turns the verb phrase into
the causative version of itself. In English, this is often accomplished using
the "to have" or "to make" helper verb but sometimes there is a completely
separate verb for the causative version of an action.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo ölë nıwos zonwul lı ëo mötö müt xünyu.&emsp;<em>I had the barn burned down.</em></p>
    <p>nimü ölë niün boifön ëo nonto.&emsp;<em>You're making them cry.</em></p>
    <p>umo Zon ke wëko ëo si fecko longı hoi nıwos niün.&emsp;<em>John will have his house painted.</em></p>
    <p>öni bëüdo fohoso ëo si dënëmëk kon cukto niün.&emsp;<em>The students get their essays checked.</em></p>
    <p>öni cüdo yë cigilsu ölë öni diyondë ke xokülü ëo öni cigilsu.&emsp;<em>The doctor will have the nurse call the patients.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Perfective

The perfective verb modifier (<HisyeoWord is='si'/>) turns the verb phrase into
the perfective version of itself. This describes the action as being a complete
whole in contrast to the *imperfective* aspect (the default) of verbs which is
describes the event from a moment adjacent or within the whole action's
duration, a perspective from a single point along the entire occurrence. There
is no equivalent helper verb in English, sometimes the verb used to describe a
whole action is completely different from the verb used to describe the action
in the imperfective aspect.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo xüsten oütö.&emsp;<em>I wash the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo p'ılık xüstën oütö.&emsp;<em>I was washing the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo xüstën si oütö.&emsp;<em>I washed the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo p'ılık xüstën si oütö.&emsp;<em>I had washed the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo ke xüstën oütö.&emsp;<em>I shall wash the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo ke xüstën si oütö.&emsp;<em>I will have washed the car.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
