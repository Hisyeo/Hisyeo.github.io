# Nouns

A type of word that represents an entity (tangible or intangible). Can be
represented by a Noun Phrase (NP) which contains a nucleus and surrounding
quantifiers and modifiers.

## Roles

### Causer / Voluntary Subject

The <HisyeoWord is='ü'/> particle precedes this noun phrase. If this is the
first noun phrase of a sentence, the particle can be omitted.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role represents the *causer*. During
non-causative sentences, a NP with this role will be the **agent** or
**experiencer** of the action or state. Additionally during non-causative
sentences, the marked noun phrase is making the choice to commit the act or
experience the state of the predicate of their own free will. 

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the subject of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but by something other
than the marked noun phrase.

### Causee / Involuntary Subject

The <HisyeoWord is='ölë'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role will represent the *causee*.
During non-causative sentences, an NP with this role will be the agent or
experiencer of the action. Additionally during non-causative sentences, the
marked noun phrase is **not** making the choice to commit the act of their own
free will. Either they are bound/forced to do so or they do not have the
wherewithal to make a conscious choice on the matter and are acting out of some
basic instinst.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/> it has the
equivalent semantic interpretation as the voluntary subject particle <HisyeoWord is='ü'/>.

### Patient, Theme, Stimulus (Direct Object)

Any one of the verb words precedes this noun phrase. Between the verb and the
noun phrase can exist several verb modifier particles. See [Verbs](./verbs.mdx)
for more details.

The role of this object is for the special thematic argument to transitive
verbs. The argument (the direct object) can be broken down into sub-types: a
*patient*, a *theme*, or a *stimulus*. In English, this represents some of the
senses of the word "to" and "into" (many English verbs don't rely on a
preposition particle to introduce their direct object).

:::caution Base Verbs Without This Particle

You can provide a verb prepositionally without also providing a direct object
NP. Simply start another preposition, use a connector to create a compound
sentence, use a comma to end a clause or use a period to end a sentence. Not
using this particle can have an impact on how base verb sentences are
interpreted. Without providing a direct object, a base verb is interpreted as
being *intransitive* or in an unthematic and generic manner (since no theme is
being provided). That being said, sometimes it's easiest to just think of an
implicit <HisyeoWord is='nı'/> existing in the direct object slot.

:::

A **patient** is an entity that undergoes the action and changes state in some
manner. A **theme** is an entiy that undergoes the action but doesn't change
state. A **stimulus** is an entity that prompts or triggers the emotional or
sensory action that is being described. These kinds of direct objects aren't
separately marked because which kind of object is being specified can be
determined from the verb that is being used.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the argument of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with an object
that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Manner or Material

The <HisyeoWord is='bı'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent the manner or material of the
predicate. In English, this is represented by the use of words with the "-ly"
suffix (adverbs) or some senses of the words "by" and "with".

:::info Thematic Relations

This preposition and the remaining described here can be used with intransitive
and transitive verb predicates and are only needed in certain circumstances when
extra thematic information is useful to describing the predicate in a new way.
These prepositions are known as **true thematic relations**. Subjects
(<HisyeoWord is='ü'/> or <HisyeoWord is='ölë'/>) are honorary members of the
thematic relation club since they are usually called **morphosyntactic
arguments**. They are included in the same class of word as the true thematic
relations to simplify the grammatical system. This system is what allows the
language to have **free constituent ordering**.

:::

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the manner or material of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but in a
manner that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In English, this
represents some of the senses of the word "without".

### Instrument or Means

The <HisyeoWord is='tö'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent some entity that was used to carry out
the action. In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "with",
"using", "by", and "via".

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the means or instrument of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but by means
or with an object that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the word "without".

### Location or Time

The <HisyeoWord is='hoi'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where or when the action occurs. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the words "in", "at", and "on".

The counterpart of this particle is <HisyeoWord is='lon'/> for distance and
duration. Unlike the <HisyeoWord is='lon'/> particle, when you provide an amount
of time to <HisyeoWord is='hoi'/> it means the length of time that it took to
achieve the task specified in the rest of the predicate.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the location or time of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but at a
location or time that is somewhere other than the marked noun phrase.

### Direction or Destination (Indirect Object)

The <HisyeoWord is='müt'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where the action is directed towards.
In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "to", "into", and
"towards". Any time you might need an **indrect object** or **recipient**, you
can use this preposition to describe that constituent.

:::info Reciprocity

When you use this preposition with this noun phrase:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>xokön dizel</p>
</HisyeoTabs>

it means that the predicate is a *reciprocal* action which means that it
happened between the subjects instead of the subjects directing that action
towards some other referred entity.

:::

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the recipient of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with recipient
that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Source or Origin

The <HisyeoWord is='sün'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where the action originated. In
English, this represents nearly all of the senses of the word "from" (except for
differentiation and causation).

marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the source or origin of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
source or origin that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Beneficiary or Purpose

the reason for the action. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
word "for".

:::info The differences between the distance/duration role and the location/time role

These two roles might at first seem like a trivial distinction given that
quantities already contextually indicate that you are referring to distance or
duration. You can provide a point in time or space to this preposition and it
will be treated like the act had some unknown start time and the end time was
either specified by this noun phrase or is reached when the destination
specified is reached.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo lı lö müt gufuyo hoi suhot tukwos yë bıtün xobëk.&emsp;<em>"I was going to the market at 8 o'clock last night."</em></p>
    <p>noyo lı lö müt gufuyo lon suhot tukwos hoi bıtün xobëk.&emsp;<em>"I was going to the market until 8 o'clock last night."</em></p>
    <p>niün bı fiki lı lö müt gito könyëc lon xe dëko si gufuyo cüti yë iskö yë küöxı nomü müncü.&emsp;<em>"He was running to the finish line until he saw the lemonade stand."</em></p>
    <p>niün bı fiki lı lö müt gito könyëc hoi xe dëko si gufuyo cüti yë iskö yë küöxı nomü müncü.&emsp;<em>"He was running to the finish line at the time he saw the lemonade stand."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

To better understand why it's necessary to distinguish this from location/time,
it might be useful to see the semantic relationship of four of the thematic
roles:

- The **source/origin** role represents a *true* source/origin, sometimes
  contextually distant/ from the action or state.
- The **location/time** role represents the source/origin of just the act or
  state described in the sentence.
- The **destination/recipient** role represents a true destination/recipient,
  sometimes contextually distant/removed from the action or state.
- The **distance/duration** role represents the destination/recipient of just
  the act or state described in the sentence.
  
Using the term "recipient" loosely here, the only time an animate entity would
be provided as a noun phrase to a **distance/duration** preposition would be if
that entity related to a specific moment or location upon the path or duration
of the action or state at which point it ceases.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo hoi öhël tulutı tö oütö gisgül noyo müt fenüo Kolıfölnyo lon umo Sëlo.&emsp;<em>"I was riding my bike to California until Sarah."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the distance or duration of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
duration or distance that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Intermediate

The <HisyeoWord is='gıtno'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for a NP that represents either:
- an entity that the action or state is in the *midst* of,
- an entity that the action or state *was* in the midst of but is now on the other
  side, or
- a conjunction of two NPs that represent two boundaries in time or space that the
  action occurs *between*.

In English, this represents some senses of the word "between" or "through".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo köi mokon wutun höfezi xe gıtno biek wutun.&emsp;<em>"I could eat a hamburger."</em></p>
  <p>nü küu tulutı gıtno tohılök pümi onö oxon xe bucono woküt.&emsp;<em>"We should go through the mountains to save time."</em></p>
  <p>nimü köi dëko oütö onö gıtno kümun oboki zonübi onö ko.&emsp;<em>"Can you see the car through the south window?"</em></p>
  <p>gıtno nimü ün noyo ü hiskünco in köson Hisyëö lı xön möi&emsp;<em>"Between you and me, Hisyëö is the best conlang."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the intermediary entity of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with an
intermediary that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Similative

The <HisyeoWord is='mıslı'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for a NP that represents something that the action or state of
the predicate resembles or is a likeness of. It can also be used to introduce a
[simile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simile). In English, this represents some
of the senses of the words "like" and "as". When used with a subordinate clause,
it can also represent the English phrase "as if".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>xoinbo dëko ü loı mıslı sıskın loı.&emsp;<em>"He looks like his brother."</em></p>
  <p>si tüu cö künhiun bis ü umo moskül nokdo mıslı xe ke zigil.&emsp;<em>"The old man stumbled, as if he were about to fall."</em></p>
  <p>golfon onö fos noyo oncëmon nı cıhöü xe dëko non foko ösölë yë könyëc wëxön fëlcin mıslı yök ozüul fın fos noyo oncëmon si hoi öhël.&emsp;<em>The disgust I felt after watching last weekend's horror movie was unlike anything I had felt before.</em></p>
  <p>umo Kıloüdio bı xünyu cokyen iskö fın cübü mıslı yök umo Fılıt fos poxö kon iskö cübü bı cokyen lı nıwos düi yë.&emsp;<em>Claudia hardly ever drinks beer or wine, unlike Phillip, for whom the bar is practically a second home.</em></p>
  <p>xe lı müun, mıslı yök niün&emsp;<em>Being late is unlike him.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is not a likeness of the action or state of the predicate. In
English, the word "unlike" would be an equivalent.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>mıslı yök nimü lı yök öni cıfulo yë xön ëto ü noyo.&emsp;<em>"Unlike you, I'm not a great dancer."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Genitive

The <HisyeoWord is='yë'/> particle precedes this noun phrase. There is a key
syntactic difference from the other preposition phrases. For noun phrases with a
genitive role, they appear directly after another noun phrase, they are not
free-standing constituents of the sentence.

This role is used for a noun phrase that is either:

- an attribute
- a possessor, or
- has some other relationship

to the preceding noun. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
word "of".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>niün bı xoinbo lı fonmot yë kon oncëmon umo.&emsp;<em>"He seemed devoid of human feelings."</em></p>
  <p>bëmon in cukto onö köi di niltügu hoi ozüul woküt tö bëmon yë möi düi zomo.&emsp;<em>"The contract can be terminated at any time with the agreement of both parties."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::info Genitive Relationships

Using a genitive preposition phrase can create *many different* relationships
between two noun phrases. What these relationships are differs depending on the
context and the words chosen.

Below are a multitude of interesting genitive relationships from around the
world. Not every example is directly translatable into English using the
aforemented "of". Often English makes use of alternative prepositions like
"with", "by", and "for", whereas Hisyëö only has those kinds of prepositions
attached to a predicate of a sentence (essentially, they are associated to the
verb of the sentence).

However, equipped with the simple <HisyeoWord is='yë'/> preposition, context,
and supporting word choices, you can effectively communicate all of these
genitive relations. If your interlocutor still does not understand, you can make
use of clarifying words to achieve the specific meaning you were after.

__Descriptive Genitive__ - Specifies some detail of the preceding phrase.
"described by" or "characterized by" are equivalent English expressions. This is
a catch-all genitive for when the attribution is ambiguous.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>tömös yë ocüo hünsık&emsp;<em>"book characterized by a red cover"</em> <small>(lit. book of red skin)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

If you need to explain that the book has a red skin instead of being about red
skin, you can clarify that the genitive relationship is descriptive by using <HisyeoWord is='di'/>:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>tömös yë di yë ocüo hünsık&emsp;<em></em> <small>(lit. book of a quality of red skin)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Possessive Genitive__ - Specifies the preceding phrase as being owned or
possessed by the attached genitive phrase. "belonging to" or "possessed by" are
English equivalents.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>cikinil yë zonwul&emsp;<em>"ear belonging to an animal"</em> <small>(lit. ear of animal)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify that a genitive relationship is possessive by using <HisyeoWord is='yünyoü'/>: 

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>cikinil yë yünyoü yë zonwul&emsp;<small>(lit. ear of possession of animal)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Familial Genitive__ - Specifies the preceding phrase as having a familial
relationship with the attached genitive phrase. "related to" is an equivalent
English expression. This is considered a subset of Possessive Genitive.

</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Partitive Genitive__ - Specifies the preceding phrase as being part of some
larger whole or set. "Which is part of" is an equivalent expression in English.

---

__Attributive Genitive__ - Specifies the attached genitive phrase as being an
attribute or innate quality of the preceding phrase. Semantically similar to
regular modifier usage but more emphatic in its attribution.

    <p>ilë yë ködus&emsp;<em>"sacred building"</em> <small>(lit. building of sacredness)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify a genitive relationship is attributive by using <HisyeoWord is='di'/>

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>zomo ximu yë yünyoü limien yë micin&emsp;<small>(lit. water body of inner possession of fish)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Epexegetical Genitive__ - Specifies the attached genitive phrase as being
another *separate* way to explain the preceding phrase. "which is", "that is",
"namely", "who is" are equivalent English expressions.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>cüdo yë mokon&emsp;<em>"gift which is food"</em> <small>(lit. gift of food)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify this genitive relationship by using a subordinate clause and a

</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Genitive of Production__ - Specifies that the preceding phrase is made by the

  <p>non yë foko ösölë&emsp;<small>(lit. movie/show of afraid-ifyer)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

__Subjective Genitive__ - Specifies or describes the subject of the preceding
phrase when the preceding phrase is a verb phrase or a noun phrase that contains

sentence where the genitive noun phrase is the object of the action.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>köto nü yë mocko&emsp;<em>"our conversation about cats"</em> <small>(lit. our speech of cats)</small></p>
  <p>kelo yë fos sınsi noyo (lı gö) dën sınsi dizel onö&emsp;<em>"a game of my city against the other city"</em> <small>(lit. game of which my city (is) against another city)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify this genitive relationship by replacing the whole relation with
a subordinate noun clause while describing the object (and <HisyeoWord is='kös'/> can

---

__Plenary Genitive__ - Specifies or describes the subject and object of the

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>kon yübik yë öcöto&emsp;<em>"love of God"</em> <small>(lit. loving of God)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify this genitive relationship by replacing the whole relation with
a subordinate noun clause and <HisyeoWord is='xokön'/> <HisyeoWord is='dizel'/>:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo ün öcöto yübik xokön dizel.&emsp;<small>(lit. I and God love each other)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

This particle isn't used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>
because it's meant to describe nouns through associating other nouns and there's
already an existing way to describe zero nouns (<HisyeoWord is='xünyu'/>). You can
achieve a similar kind of negative association by using a relative clause.

Converting from the other content types into nouns.

### Verbs

When a verb acts as a noun, it represents an archetypal object that has or will
be involved in the happening of that verb action. Like the suffix "-ed" in
English but also there are many concrete terms that English has to refer to
these entities already. These are direct objects, patients and themes that would
be logical to use in a sentence where you use that verb.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nimü ke cöüfon mokon xe gıtno biek, ko.&emsp;<em>"Will you make me a sandwich?"</em> <small>(lit. You will cook food that is between bread, yes?)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Another way is to create a genitive phrase by preceding the modifier with
the <HisyeoWord is='yë'/> particle. This particle means the verb word that
immediately following it is taken as the noun derivation of that verb.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>müt noyo küu oköt dıbo öfo yë conwëbo&emsp;<em>"Bring me that box of goods"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Modifiers

When a modifier acts as a noun, it means an uncountable quality and/or degree of
being a given state. Like the affix "-ness" in English. One way of making a noun
out of a modifier is to provide it as the nucleus of a verb or a preposition
phrase. Verbs and preposition particles always take the word is immediately
following it as a noun derivation of that word and it is the nucleus of the
preposition phrase (as long as it's a content word, other prepositions can cause
argument to be skipped).

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>wölık nëlö kös küyö&emsp;<em>"Black clouds cause sadness."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Just like with verbs you canc reate a genitive phrase by preceding the modifier
with the <HisyeoWord is='yë'/> particle. This particle means that the modifier
word that immediately following it is taken as the noun derivation of that word.

This is especially useful for the typical reason that genitive phrases are
useful: it allows you to describe a quality with some modifiers of its own. One
of the most common usages is when adding a degree to a modifier:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>töxütsı bümi yë ıwotë ëto</p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Since Hisyëö has less than 800 words, using genitive phrases with modifiers
allows you to create more complex phrases that would require several sentences
to formulate otherwise. 

## Noun Clauses

A noun can be concrete or abstract, it doesn't have to be some physical entity
or even a finite state. It can be a process or really anything that you might
want to refer to and use as a subject or object of a sentence. In Hisyëö, you
can create these complex nouns by building sentences within a special clause
called a **Noun Clause**. In order to create one of these clauses, you must
start with a particle. There are two special words available that can be used
to introduce a noun clause:

<ol>
  <li><HisyeoWord is='xe'/> - Use this one for infinitives and gerunds</li>
  <li><HisyeoWord is='fos'/> - Use this one for complete inner sentences</li>
</ol>

After this particle, you start your sentence. In the infinitive/gerund form, you
do not provide an agent/experiencer (subject) of the sentence because this is
the nature of how infinitives are used: a noun that refers to the meaning
expressed by the inner sentence but referred holisitically as an object in the
outer sentence.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>lı ëo govon ölë noyo ü <strong>xe</strong> cöüfon micin.&emsp;<em>"Cooking fish makes me disgusted"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


:::caution Beware the similarity between gerunds and the abstract particle

While these noun clause gerunds are very useful, you must be careful to discern
the distinction of meaning between the gerund usage of a noun clause leading
particle and the abstract particle preceding a content word. The abstract form
should be thought of as "acts of" or "matters of" which should be seen as more
of a loose relationship than using a noun clause as a gerund. "acts/matters of
eating meat" means something different from "eating meat".

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo toüyen xe mokon oksün.</p>
    <p>noyo toüyen kon mokon oksün.</p>
</HisyeoTabs>


The first sentence implies that the speaker hates specifically the act of eating
meat whereas the second sentence implies that the speaker hates matters of meat
eating altogether which broadens the hate to anything related to the act or its
part in human life or otherwise. 

:::

The other form of noun phrase (<HisyeoWord is='fos'/>) includes a subject or if
one is not provided then, like a normal sentence, it should be intepreted as
"there is" or "it is" depending on the predicate that is provided. This form of
noun phrase is useful when you need to introduce a clause that changes (or
removes) the subject from the underlying sentence. Some verbs primarily are used
with some form of noun clause as their object and this form allows for a
complete sentence to be included as that object.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo fölun fos nimü fölun noyo&emsp;<em>"I want you to want me"</em></p>
  <p>noyo xiwon fos lı suhot tiü&emsp;<em>"I wish that it was 5 o'clock"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


:::note English indirect object

The English sentence in the translation above "I want you to want me" is using
an indirect object of "you" and an direct object infinitve phrase of "to want
me". This might seem like the wrong translation since there is a preposition
that Hisyëö typically uses for indirect objects. This is just an example of some
of the irregular English grammar around the use of the verb "to want". In
Hisyëö, the best approach is to use a finite noun phrase where the indirect
object of the English sentence is now the subject of the inner noun clause.

:::

There are other uses of these same clause particles as relative clause
introducers and you can learn more about those usages in the Modifiers chapter.
