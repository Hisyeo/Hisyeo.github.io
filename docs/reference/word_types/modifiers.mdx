# Modifiers

A type of word that describes a verb or noun.

## Prepositions

There are only a few prepositions applicable to the modifier class of words.

### Positive

The <HisyeoWord is="in"/> particle allows you to specify that any content word
which is being used as a modifier is seen as positive in meaning when applied as
a modifier to the preceding head phrase. This is primarily useful for using
verbs as modifiers since they are prepositions otherwise.

### Negatitive

The <HisyeoWord is="dës"/> particle allows you to specify that any content word
which is being used as a modifier is seen as negated in meaning when applied as
a modifier to the preceding head phrase. While this is useful for using verbs as
modifiers, it also can be useful for all other modifiers and nouns as
modifiers.

### Collapsing Head

The <HisyeoWord is="et"/> particle allows you to specify that any following
modifier (whether it's a true modifier or a noun/verb being used with one of
the modifier particles above or a noun particle) is seen as applying meaning to
the *entire* noun or verb phrase instead of only being applicable to the
immediately preceding head phrase.

## From...

Converting from the other content types into modifiers.

### Nouns

When a noun acts as a modifier, it means that the head word is somehow related
to the noun (acting as a modifer) or shares some recognizable quality with the
noun. Like the affix "-like" in English. One way of making a modifier out of a
noun is to provide it as a word immediately following <HisyeoWord is="vın"/>.
This has the effect of meaning "[noun]-like thing" in English. You can use it
following any head noun or existing modifier chain.


### Verbs

A verb cannot act as a modifier, it must be preceded by either a modifier or a
noun particle. The verb and particle combined act as one word of the base
modifier type. You can use it following any head noun or existing modifier
chain.


## Relative Clauses

You can modify a preceding verb or noun phrase by using one of the relative
clause particles:
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>xe - <em>Use this one when the subject is shared from the outer sentence</em></p>
    <p>vos - <em>Use this one when the subject is changed from the outer sentence</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When you use the second form (<HisyeoWord is="vos"/>), you must provide at least
one constituent that refers to the verb or noun phrase, this is called the
**resumptive phrase**. Hisyëö uses the demonstratives as resumptive pronouns
within resumptive phrases. Use the proximal demonstrative
(<HisyeoWord is="övo"/>) when referring to the speaker or objects that the
speaker possesses, use the medial demonstrative (<HisyeoWord is="ulyö"/>)
when referring to the person being addressed or objects possesed by that person,
use the distal demonstrative (<HisyeoWord is="onö"/>) when referring to someone
else other than the person being addressed or objects possessed by that third
party.
