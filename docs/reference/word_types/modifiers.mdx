# Modifiers

A type of word that describes a verb or noun.

## Prepositions

There are only a few prepositions applicable to the modifier class of words.

### Positive

The <HisyeoWord is="in"/> particle allows you to specify that any content word
which is being used as a modifier is seen as positive in meaning when applied as
a modifier to the preceding head phrase. This is primarily useful for using
verbs as modifiers since they are prepositions otherwise.

### Negatitive

The <HisyeoWord is="dës"/> particle allows you to specify that any content word
which is being used as a modifier is seen as negated in meaning when applied as
a modifier to the preceding head phrase. While this is useful for using verbs as
modifiers, it also can be useful for all other modifiers and nouns as
modifiers.

### Collapsing Head

The <HisyeoWord is="et"/> particle allows you to specify that any following
modifier (whether it's a true modifier or a noun/verb being used with one of
the modifier particles above or a noun particle) is seen as applying meaning to
the *entire* noun or verb phrase instead of only being applicable to the
immediately preceding head phrase.

This particle is also useful for ending a determiner-led phrase before a nucleus
can be added thus making the determiner phrase headless which means that the
determiner is instead interpreted pronomically. 

:::caution Verb Immunity

Verbs cannot be preceded by a collapsing head particle directly. This is because
the collapsing head particle does not change the semantics of that syntactic
position. It simply closes the prior elements as a new nucleus and then the
syntactic context of the following word is as a modifier of that newly collapsed
nucleus.

If you need to describe the newly formed nucleus with a verb, you must use one
of particles that converts a verb to a noun or modifier derivation.

## From...

Converting from the other content types into modifiers.

### Nouns

When a noun acts as a modifier, it means that the head word is somehow related
to the noun (acting as a modifer) or shares some recognizable quality with the
noun. Like the affix "-like" in English. One way of making a modifier out of a
noun is to provide it as a word immediately following <HisyeoWord is="fın"/>.
This has the effect of meaning "[noun]-like thing" in English. You can use it
following any head noun or existing modifier chain (within a genitive phrase).

That said, nouns often don't need any added particle, but when the noun is
action-oriented, it can be useful to use the abstract noun particle (<HisyeoWord is="kon"/>) or
the modifier particles above. This helps differentiate the attributed thing from
being attributed directly to the action itself compared to things that are used
*for* an action or are more tangentially related.


### Verbs

A verb cannot act as a modifier, it must be preceded by either one of the
modifier particles above or a [noun particle](nouns#verbs). The verb and particle combined act
as one word of the base modifier type. You can use it following any head noun or
existing modifier chain.


## Relative Clauses

You can modify a preceding verb or noun phrase by using one of the relative
clause particles:
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>xe - <em>Use this one when the subject is shared from the outer sentence</em></p>
    <p>fos - <em>Use this one when the subject is changed from the outer sentence</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When you use the second form (<HisyeoWord is="fos"/>), you must provide at least
one constituent that refers to the verb or noun phrase, this is called the
**resumptive phrase**. Hisyëö uses the demonstratives as resumptive pronouns
within resumptive phrases. Use the proximal demonstrative
(<HisyeoWord is="öfo"/>) when referring to the speaker or objects that the
speaker possesses, use the medial demonstrative (<HisyeoWord is="ulyö"/>)
when referring to the person being addressed or objects possesed by that person,
use the distal demonstrative (<HisyeoWord is="onö"/>) when referring to someone
else other than the person being addressed or objects possessed by that third
party.
