# Introduction

## What is Hîsyêô?

A small language for people around the world to communicate with each other
about big ideas.  Hîsyêô was designed using these principles:

### Neutrality
Words are sourced from all world languages proportional to the square root of
their world population of [L1
speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language). Many people who come to
learn Hîsyêô have a small anchor of familiarity within the lexicon. It also is
meant to symbolize our sacred bond to our collective linguistic heritage. 

Additionally, the grammar is an analytic isolating language like its forebears
[Kokanu](https://www.kokanu.com/) and [Toki Pona](https://tokipona.org).
Analytic isolating languages remove the mutation of words by making grammatical
syntax separate particle words. Alternatively, many languages mutate or attach
lexemes to root words in order to achieve similar grammatical means.

It is the belief of the creators of this language that there's no one system
that can reflect all ways of thinkings, be sufficiently comprehensible, and be
easy to teach. So a complete moderately-naturalistic system was developed that
improves expressiveness at the cost of some amount of neutrality. However, since
the grammar provides more functionality and conventions than some minimalist
languages, Hîsyêô is able to reduce ambiguity which the creators of the language
believe to be a second-order form of neutrality.

### Succinctness
Words are kept to a minimum where possible but information density is strongly
emphasized so that the language can still be used for translations of scientific
and artistic media. This principle is not the same as the more strict principle
of *minimalism* in that it is meant to allow for including singular words from
(1) concepts that appear in a multitude of conversations and (2) concepts that
would need complex nested clauses that can otherwise derail a sentence from
comprehension due to the added working memory to develop an understanding of the
sentence.

Careful consideration is made that the semantic spaces that each individual word
supports do not overlap the semantic spaces of other words although there are
some hypernyms and hyponyms for certain groups of words. There should always be
a more verbose way to explain a word which can aid in clarifying intended
meaning and allows for a proper Hîsyêô-to-Hîsyêô dictionary.


### Expressivity
The language is designed to be highly expressive in its word and grammar
choices. With just over 850 words, there's a lot more ways (compared to
minimalist languages) to express feelings, emotions, objects, actions and
anything else you can think of.

Additionally, the grammar has been greatly enhanced from its origin to allow for
handling of tense, aspect, mood, causation, and volition. The language has been
tested against a multitude of translation media to confirm that no concept is
too challenging or too verbose to express.

## Is Hîsyêô An International Auxiliary Language?

Some of these principles, the orthography and grammatical features that you will
learn may seem contrary to the practices of any self-respecting [International
Auxiliary Language](http://interlanguages.net). Hîsyêô **does not** strictly
follow the tradional principles (and isn't seeking to fit in any kind of
IAL-shaped box). The creators of the language believe that too much effort
within IAL development is spent on regularization and cherrypicking existing
lexical and grammatical tactics of natural languages (while applying some first
language bias regardless of the best intentions). Instead, Hîsyêô pushes closer
to an [artlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) or a
[loglang](https://loglangs.wiki/Portal) by focusing less on the linguistic
equivalent of [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) and instead
striving for a more complete "batteries-included" language.

## Where did Hîsyêô come from?

Hîsyêô was borne out of a desire from a member of the Kokanu community to grow
Kokanu into something that could truly be versatile enough to be used for
translations of popular media, scientific papers and philosophical treateses.
Unfortunately for him, the Kokanu community intends the language to be as
minimalist as possible and so the density of information when translating is not
a consideration. Neither translation of media nor scientific communication are
goals of the language. This community member spent considerable time becoming
fluent in Kokanu and enjoyed the grammatical foundation that it offered. He was
inspired by an at-the-time new kokanido
([koanu](https://web.archive.org/web/20231127095333/https://www.parallax.net.nz/x/koanu/)) and decided to try to create his
own kokanido, enhancing it with some ideas taken from other constructed and
natural languages.

## The Basics

Now that you understand why and where Hîsyêô came from, let's learn enough to
write a few basic sentences.

### Rules

1. Words do not ever mutate, special particles are used to introduce phrases of
   the sentence.
2. Verbs can be used as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs depending on what particle
   introduced them into the sentence. 
3. There are no definiteness articles like "the" or "a/an".
4. The basic structure of a sentence is any amount of phrasal constituents
   introduced by prepositions (thematic phrases) or verbs (object phrases).
5. If the agent/experiencer phrase is placed as the first constituent of a
   sentence, then the particle that introduces the phrase can be omitted.

### Usage

Some basic words to get you started on sentence construction.

#### Choose a subject:
<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>noyo&emsp;<em>I</em></p>
   <p>nîmû&emsp;<em>you</em></p>
   <p>nûs&emsp;<em>we</em></p>
   <p>nîo&emsp;<em>they</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Choose a verb:
<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>kôto&emsp;<em>to say</em></p>
   <p>monodo&emsp;<em>to meet</em></p>
   <p>mokon&emsp;<em>to eat</em></p>
   <p>fisun&emsp;<em>to know</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Choose an object:
<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>ulyô&emsp;<em>that</em></p>
   <p>kûôxi&emsp;<em>fruit</em></p>
   <p>bîolî&emsp;<em>hello</em></p>
   <p>sûtûô&emsp;<em>friend</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Choose a sentence ender:
<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>lôtfen&emsp;<em>polite</em></p>
   <p>foxo&emsp;<em>surprise</em></p>
   <p>ko&emsp;<em>question</em></p>
   <p>lôîcôk&emsp;<em>confirmation</em></p>
   <p><em>or none</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Now, make a sentence...

<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>noyo mokon kûôxi&emsp;<em>I eat fruit</em></p>
   <p>nîmû fisun sûtûô noyo ko&emsp;<em>Do you know my friend?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
