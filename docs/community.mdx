# Community

So, you've decided that you want to learn and be part of this community? Well,
read on!

## How can I join the community?

There isn't an online community yet built for this here language. We are working
on a public discord community that will have levels that you can earn as you
grow in the language.

In addition to this enterprise, we also seek to grow the language in the public
domain. A set of courses and tests are being developed that follow the six
levels of the
[CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)
standard. Eventually, some of lower course certificates and tests will
supplement the manually-curated community priveleges.

## Where can I meet existing community members?

If you'd like to discuss the language without seeking to learn it, please keep
all those discussions to the various conglang communities of the internet. We
also plan to have our own official precense on other sites. Here is the list of
locations where we hope to have Hisyëans available to chat with:

- Telegram
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hisyeo/)
- Matrix
- Mastodon
- YouTube 
- GitHub Discussions

:::warning Not Yet Created
Currently, none of these public spaces are setup. Please bear with us as this is
alpha cultureware.
:::

Even if you don't plan on learning Hisyëö, we'd love to have
a chat with you in one of these public spaces!

## I'd like to contribute

We'd love for you to join our mission! There are outstanding tickets in various
projects in our GitHub organization. There are also numerous public domain works
that can be translated and, if you're interested, hosted in this site. We'd also
be glad to link to content hosted elsewhere.

Bringing more people to the language and community is also appreciated. After
acquiring some experience in speaking the language, an interview can be
requested for them to meet with one of our community leaders.

## Why so draconian?

Because we feel that like many creatures on Earth, new life is often very
fragile before becoming strong enough to thrive. A community and culture is just
the same. Once we've established a strong core of active members we'll open the
community up for folks who want to use the ongoing conversations for
comprehensible input.

## How can I help support financially?

We are currently looking into ways we can begin fundraising.
