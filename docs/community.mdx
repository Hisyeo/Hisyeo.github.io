# Community

So, you've decided that you want to learn and be part of this community? Well,
read on!

## Expectations

We expect members of the community, in addition to any code of conduct present
within a specific location, to also be mindful of these values of the Hîsyêô
community:

- be kind and gentle with new leaners
- don't police correct grammar, follow correct grammar yourself
- participate with active listening and engaging responses
- remember that *everyone* that seeks to learn Hîsyêô matters and should be
  cherished

## How can I join the community?

Here are all of the sites/apps where Hîsyêô has a presence:

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hisyeo/)
- [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#hisyeo:matrix.org)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/48mUPRan9G)
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@hisyeo)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Hisyeo/discussions)

## I'd like to contribute

We'd love for you to join our mission! Community participation is a central
tenet of the Hîsyêô community. There may be outstanding tickets in various
projects in our GitHub organization. There are also numerous public domain works
that can be translated and, if you're interested, hosted on this site or within
the github organization. We'd also be glad to link to content hosted elsewhere.
