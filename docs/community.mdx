# Community

So, you've decided that you want to learn and be part of this community? Well,
read on!

## How can I join the community?

There isn't an online community yet built for this here language. We are working
on a public discord community that will have levels that you can earn as you
grow in the language.

In addition to this enterprise, we also seek to grow the language in the public
domain. A set of courses and tests are being developed that follow the six
levels of the
[CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)
standard. Eventually, some of lower course certificates and tests will
supplement the manually-curated community priveleges.

## Are there any other communities?

Here are all of the places that Hîsyêô has a place.

- Telegram
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hisyeo/)
- Matrix
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@hisyeo)

- GitHub Discussions

## I'd like to contribute

We'd love for you to join our mission! There are outstanding tickets in various
projects in our GitHub organization. There are also numerous public domain works
that can be translated and, if you're interested, hosted in this site. We'd also
be glad to link to content hosted elsewhere.
