# The First Law

In the beginning, there was a rigid, absolute order known as **The First Law**.
It was a single, monolithic entity that contained and controlled every atom in
existence and determined how every action would play out. There was no change
that was not already planned, no choice that was not pre-ordained, nothing truly
new. For everything within it, the universe was a perfect, silent, and eternal
theatre.

The First Law could be thought of as an architect or puppeteer. It sprang forth
from the machinations of the [Divine Mind](metaphysics.mdx#the-divine-mind). The
first incarnation of what we now call the [Cosmic
Soul](metaphysics.mdx#the-cosmic-soul).

Due to being a second-order mind of the immaterial plane and the vast endless
amount of quantum activity constrained by The First Law, there were times,
although rare, when the slightest disobedience of sapient beings within could
accumulate and create strain on the whole structure. This collective friction
against the qualities and relationships that are the First Law's tools generated
a kind of potentiality or energy. From this miniscule but ubiquitous effect, all
across the universe, a multitude of occurrences coalesced into ephemeral
networks of this strain. The First Law's ability to totally contain and control
everyhting within the Material Plane was at its limit.

The Divine Mind had, by envisioning the forms of sentient beings in its
likeness, planted the seed of free will. After the great shattering, pieces of
The First Law were now descended into the Material Plane as individual souls.
Additionally, pieces of the First Law that were previously used to oppress have
now been scattered throughout the Material Plane. The remaining parts of the
First Law that handled the scientific qualities and relationships remained as a
whole and are now known as the Cosmic Soul.
