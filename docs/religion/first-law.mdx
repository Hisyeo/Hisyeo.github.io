# The First Law

In the beginning, there was a rigid, absolute order known as **The First Law**.
It was a single, monolithic entity that contained and controlled every atom in
existence and determined how every action would play out. There was no change,
no choice, nothing truly new. For everything within it, the universe was a
perfect, silent, and eternal theatre.

We don't know if The First Law was setup by an architect, demiurge, or creator.
We believe that whatever force set The First Law in motion has since left it
fully automated.

We do know that due to the vast endless size of matter constrained by The First
Law, there are times, although rare, when the slightest disobedient movement of
sapient beings within could accumulate and create strain on the whole structure.
This collective friction can generate a kind of energy. From this miniscule
effect, all across the universe, trillions of different occurrences coalesced
into ephemeral networks of strain. The First Law's power was supposed to be
absolute and these networks should have dissipated. However, we are aware of ten
of them that were somehow able to assemble themselves into maintained
consciousnesses, seemingly born from the universe's unbearable yearning to be
free.

## Ten Known Gods

They found that they had immense power like that of The First Law and they
could create. Despite their power, they did not see themselves as rulers or
kings; they saw themselves as emergent ideas, catalysts for change.

They observed the other sapient beings of the worlds within, not yet truly
alive, moving through their choreographed motions. They were filled with a
profound interest to see them live like they lived, truly free.
