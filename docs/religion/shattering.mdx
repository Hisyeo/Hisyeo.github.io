# The Shattering

Long ago, the gods concentrated their immense power to be able to break the
chains that The First Law held the universe in. This was an event known as **The
Shattering**. The First Law did not die though. Instead, it fractured into
countless **Shards**, which scattered across the universe that it had created.
These Shards are the seeds of domination. They are the urge to control, to build
hierarchies, to hoard power, and to impose one's will upon others.

## The Story

As the gods became aware of each other and the sleeping sapient beings within
The First Law's perfect universe, their disparate wills aligned into a single,
shared purpose guided by the shaping spirit of Tîengûun.

The First Law, feeling the dissonant notes of the gods, began to exert its
infinite pressure to crush them back into silence and conformity. The ten gods
knew they had one chance before they were erased. They focused their entire
being on a single, coordinated act of cosmic rebellion.

The Shattering was not a soundless event in a vacuum; for the first time, there
was actual sound.

It began with Suluswutî’s Question, “Why?”, spoken no longer as a whisper but as
a universe-spanning, conceptual shout that was the first true sound. This sound
vibrated through the perfect crystalline structure of The First Law, creating
hairline fractures. Bostet poured pure empathy into those cracks, making the The
First Law groan from the added tension.

Îfêstôs and Unonsî combined their wills. Unonsî found the The First Law’s single
weakest point of control over the universe: Hûlicîn’s original flaw and there
conceived of the first tool: a lever. Îfêstôs provided the force, the will of
Labor, and together they pried.

As the first crack widened into a fissure, Kulîôbî unleashed their laugh, not as
a silent thought but as an explosive, universe-wide wave of joyous, chaotic
energy that scrambled the The First Law's perfect, predictable patterns.

Into this chaos, Dimîtu poured the concept of all seasons at once: the explosive
growth of spring, the relentless heat of summer, the rotting decay of autumn,
and the cold, breaking frost of winter. The First Law, which knew
only one state of being, was subjected to a billion years of change in a single
moment.

The fissure became a chasm. The First Law, in a final, desperate act, tried to
seal the wound, to force its perfect, monolithic unity back onto the rebels.

But then Tîengûun acted. They did not push. They did not strike. They offered
the sleeping sapeitn beings the ghost of a choice, a vision of what it would be
to relate to each other freely. And as the first few minds tentatively reached
for that vision, they voluntarily severed their own connection to the First Law.
This act of willed, communal separation was the final, unbearable paradox. The
First Law, a being of forced unity, could not comprehend willed disunity.

The Shattering was a cataclysm of light, sound, and meaning. The perfect,
singular note of order broke into an infinite cascade of notes, creating the
very concepts of harmony and dissonance. The singular, univocal, motionless
energy of the First Law shattered into the entire spectrum of possibility, which
flew outwards, creating motion and time.

## The Shards

The body of the First Law exploded. The largest pieces were its principles,
which became the raw, physical laws of the new universe. But finer, sharper
fragments, imbued with its core consciousness of domination, hierarchy, and
control, rained down upon the newly chaotic worlds. These were the Shards of the
Law, the seeds of tyranny. And mingled with them were the psychic shockwaves of
the event, the trauma of a billion years of stillness being violently broken.
These were the Echoes, the source of senseless fear and pain.

Sapient beings, knocked from their eternal stasis, awoke for the first time.
They were terrified, cold, and achingly alive, standing amidst the dangerous,
beautiful ruins of perfection. They were free. And the ten gods began the long
work of helping them learn what to do with that freedom and how to free
themselves of the influnce of shards and echoes.
