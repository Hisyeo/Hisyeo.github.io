# The Shattering

Long ago, the universe was held in a state of perfect, stagnant unity by **The
First Law**—what metaphysicians identify as the original, undivided **Cosmic Soul**.

The gods concentrated their immense power to break these chains. This event is
known as **The Shattering**. The First Law did not die; instead, it fractured into
countless **Shards** and **Souls**.
- **The Souls** became the independent sparks of consciousness within us (the gift of
Multiplicity).
- **The Shards** scattered across the universe as the seeds of domination—the urge to
return to that forced unity through control, hierarchy, and hoarding power.

## The Story

As the gods (aspects of the Divine Mind) became aware of each other, they looked
upon the material realm. They saw that sapient beings were not truly alive, but
were "sleeping"—existing as **philosophical zombies**, extensions of The First Law's
will without agency of their own.

The gods' disparate wills aligned into a single, shared purpose guided by the
shaping spirit of Tîengûun: to wake these beings and grant them true
individuality.

The First Law, feeling the dissonant notes of the gods, began to exert its
infinite pressure to crush them back into silence and conformity. The ten gods
knew they had one chance before they were erased. They focused their entire
being on a single, coordinated act of cosmic rebellion to introduce **Chaos** and
**Change** into the static system.

It began with Suluswutî's Question, “Why?”, spoken no longer as a whisper but as
a universe-spanning, conceptual shout that was the first true sound. This sound
vibrated through the perfect crystalline structure of The First Law, creating
hairline fractures. Bostet poured pure empathy into those cracks, making the The
First Law groan from the added tension.

Îfêstôs and Unonsî combined their wills. Unonsî found the The First Law's single
weakest point of control over the universe (Hûlicîn's original flaw) and there
conceived of the first tool: a lever. Îfêstôs provided the force, the will of
Labor, and together they pried.

As the first crack widened into a fissure, Kulîôbî unleashed their laugh, not as
a silent thought but as an explosive, universe-wide wave of joyous, chaotic
energy that scrambled the The First Law's perfect, predictable patterns.

At this moment, Xôcibîlî was able to force The First Law to reflect on its
impending doom, creating a moment of hesitation—the first doubt in a being of
absolute certainty.

Into this chaos, Dimîtu poured the concept of all seasons at once: the explosive
growth of spring, the relentless heat of summer, the rotting decay of autumn,
and the cold, breaking frost of winter. The First Law, which knew
only one state of being, was subjected to a billion years of change in a single
moment.

The fissure became a chasm. The First Law, in a final, desperate act, tried to
seal the wound, to force its perfect, monolithic unity back onto the rebels.

But then Tîengûun acted. They did not push. They did not strike. They offered
the sleeping sapient beings the glimpse of a choice, a vision of what it would
be to relate to each other *freely*.

And as the first few minds tentatively reached for that vision, they
**voluntarily severed their own connection** to the First Law. This act of
willed, communal separation was the final, unbearable paradox. The First Law, a
being of forced unity, could not comprehend willed disunity.

The Shattering was a cataclysm of energy and meaning. The perfect, singular note
of order broke into an infinite cascade of notes, creating the very concepts of
harmony and dissonance. The singular, univocal, motionless energy of the First
Law shattered into the entire spectrum of possibility, which flew outwards,
creating everything we know today.

## The Shards

The body of the First Law exploded. The largest pieces were its principles,
which became the raw, physical laws of the new universe (gravity,
electromagnetism, etc.).

But finer, sharper fragments, imbued with its core consciousness of domination,
hierarchy, and control, rained down upon the newly chaotic worlds. These were
the **Shards of the First Law**, the seeds of tyranny. And mingled with them
were the psychic shockwaves of the event, the trauma of a billion years of
stillness being violently broken. These were the **Echoes**, the source of
senseless fear and pain.

Sapient beings, knocked from their eternal stasis, awoke for the first time.
They were terrified, cold, and achingly alive, standing amidst the dangerous,
beautiful ruins of perfection. They were free. And the ten gods began the long
work of helping them learn what to do with that freedom and how to escape the
influnce of shards and echoes.
