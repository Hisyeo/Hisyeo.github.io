# Beliefs

While each of the gods can be said to have their own beliefs and virtues, there
are a set of core beliefs that everyone can be said to hold:

## Core Beliefs

1. Freedom to be and act uninfluenced by others, is the most sacred state
   and must be cherished and preserved for all
2. The waking life is, in reality, a dream made manifest by the concsciousness
   that is the entire universe
3. The gods are the forms or ideas of archetypal forces made manifest in great
   and virtuous acts
3. Concurrently, those who manifest godly acts become closer themselves to the
   divine
4. Freedom and great acts can only be experienced by the most people through
   cooperation and participation by all in equal parts to which one is affected

The gods themselves are presented as divine entities and you might assume that
this means they are worshipped like gods of some religions. This *is* a valid
interpretation but it's not the only one. Many people would rather have a more
*personal* relationship or one that is meditative or contemplative. Check out
each of the gods' pages for more info on their subset of beliefs.

## Virtues

Virtues are the kinds of actions that bring greater freedom to the most people.

- **Solidarity**: Recognizing another's struggle as if it was your own and offering
  as much support as you would provide to your own problems
- **Autonomy**: Excercising free will and preserving the free will of others
- **Curiosity**: Active and engaged pursuing of new knowledge and testing old
  assumptions
- **Creativity**: Making, building, problem-solving and repairing. The application
  of free will to produce a result.
- **Stewardship**: Caring for the community and its resources. Doing work for the
  good of others or the ecosystem.
- **Adaptability**: Embracing change and continually identifying alternatives
  and backups.
- **Passionate Expression**: Fully realizing the arts of celebration, play,
  performance and exhibition in the pursuit of your truth or a hard truth about
  others or society.
- **Accountability**: Facing your mistakes and those impacted, actively
  listening to their grievances, and participating in improving yourself and
  restoring what was lost.

## Sin

There is no concept of "sin" in the sense that a divine ruler has given an
absolute commandment because there is no divine ruler in this religion. Free
will requires *absolute* freedom to be consistent. Therefore, there cannot be
any divine law that specifies that one act is good and another bad. To have sin
implies that someone can be *evil* but the autonomy of the self is sacred and
each soul is a piece of the cosmic soul that is our universe so how can a
something that is free to act as it wills and is part of the great soul of our
universe be evil? It cannot.

Instead of "sins", there are acts that are considered misalignments away from
the divine work and focused on the material world. We call them "vile" acts
because they are ethically wrong due to causing suffering in individuals, the
community or the ecosystem. These vile acts are considered to be corruptions
caused by the shards from the [shattering](./shattering.mdx) still remaining in
the world.

Some of the acts considered truly vile are:

1. **Domination**: To control another or create a hierarchy
2. **Hoarding**: To take more than one needs and prevent another's access to the
   surplus
3. **Dogmatism**: To enforce a single truth and punish questioning
4. **Punishment**: To seek vengeance or retribution rather than restorative
   justice
5. **Indifference**: To willfully ignore the suffering of others within your
   community
6. **Commodification**: To turn a shared joy into a product or spectacle.

The consequence of a vile act do not involve divine punishment now or in the
afterlife. The natural consequence of any of these acts is destructive enough
already. Connections to the community and to individuals will be broken and thus
also connections to the divine. The path of redemption involves the hard work of
regaining trust or making the hard choice to build a new set of connections in a
new community.
