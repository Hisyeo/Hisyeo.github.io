# ôtsôtot Tîengûun 🤝

Planning, Budgeting, Investment, Financials

## Beliefs

- **The best plan is a living document, not a stone tablet.** A community's
  plans and budgets must be flexible and constantly revisited, as needs and
  conditions change. To treat a plan as sacred and unchangeable is a form of
  tyranny.
- **A healthy community has many arguments.** Disagreement is not a sign of
  failure, but a sign of engagement. Silence and the absence of dissent are the
  true warnings of a society in decline. A meeting that ends without a decision
  is more successful than a decision made without consensus.
- **"Fairness" is not about everyone getting the same thing.** Fairness is about
  everyone getting what they need to thrive. True equity requires acknowledging
  different needs and circumstances.
- **Transparency is a form of trust.** All communal ledgers, resource lists, and
  meeting notes should be open, not to police each other, but to foster a
  culture of shared responsibility and knowledge.
- **Always plan to meet and revisit decisions after consensus**: The true
  measure of a decision is how it is implemented and how it feels the next day.
  A good consensus includes a plan for checking in and making adjustments.
- **A healthy community has "soft edges."** It should be easy for newcomers to
  join and for members to leave without penalty, ensuring all association is
  voluntary.
- **Facilitation is a temporary burden, not a permanent role.** To prevent the
  rise of soft hierarchies, all facilitator duties should be rotated regularly
  among all willing and capable members of the community.
- **The health of the weave is measured by its quietest thread.** A community is
  only as strong as its ability to hear and value the contributions of its most
  marginalized or shy members.

## Appearance

Tîengûun is a deity of process, and their manifestation is a subtle, rising tide
in the affairs of people. One feels their presence first not as a figure, but as
a change in the dynamics of a group. When Tîengûun draws near, disjointed
arguments begin to find a common rhythm, selfish impulses soften into a
willingness to listen, and the chaotic noise of a crowd starts to coalesce into
the productive murmur of a great assembly. When they finally take a visible
form, it is awe-inspiring not for its power, but for its complexity. Tîengûun
appears as a vast, semi-translucent being that is simultaneously a loom, a map,
and a meeting in session. Their body has a central, stable core of calm, focused
energy, but their periphery is a constant, humming motion of countless hands.
These are not their own hands, but ghostly, overlapping images of every hand in
the community: the calloused hand of the follower of Îfêstôs, the ink-stained
hand of Suluswutî’s scholar, the gentle hand of the Bostet-sworn caregiver. The
hands are engaged in the endless work of the collective: they weave glowing
threads of connection on a vast, spectral loom that forms Tîengûun’s shifting
"body"; they pass resources—glowing orbs of light representing food, tools, or
aid—from one to another in a seamless flow of mutual support; they cast votes
with stones of light; and they are raised to seek recognition to speak.
Tîengûun’s "skin," if it can be called that, resembles a living cartographical
chart or a mind map. Lines of light, like trade routes or lines of affinity,
shift and redraw themselves across their form as new connections are made and
new plans are agreed upon. Watching them is like seeing the entire social and
economic life of a community visualized in real-time. Their head is the least
distinct part of their form, often appearing as a sphere of woven light, a
physical representation of a "hive mind" or collective consciousness. It has no
single face, for to give it one would be to give the community a single ruler.
Instead, one might see fleeting, superimposed images of the community's members
as they speak or are listened to, their faces momentarily becoming part of the
godhead before receding back into the whole. The voice of Tîengûun is the
ultimate expression of their nature. It is a polyvocal hum that contains every
voice from the meeting. It is the sound of a dozen different arguments being
gently braided into a single, strong cord of consensus. It is the quiet rustle
of a thousand distributed ledgers balancing themselves. To listen to Tîengûun is
to hear disagreement, debate, and dissonance not as destructive noise, but as
the necessary, creative friction from which a truly resilient agreement is
forged. To be in Tîengûun’s presence is to feel profoundly part of something
larger than yourself, without feeling diminished. It is the feeling of being a
vital, necessary node in a great, intelligent network. They are not the will of
the people, but the process by which that will discovers itself.

## Manifestations

They are found in meetings that are going smoothly, estimations that are found
to be exact, an idea that appears in multiple people's heads simultaneously each
one enhancing the other's, a perfectly executed secret handshake, a grabbed
handful of items that ends up being precisely how many were needed, a perfectly
orchestrated plan, a noticing of an issue with a budget.
