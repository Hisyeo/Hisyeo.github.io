# ôtsôtot Wicnû 💎

Conflict resolution, transformative justice, reconciliation, ethics

## Beliefs

- **Justice is about future safety, not past punishment.** The primary goal of
  any restorative process is to ensure the harm will not happen again.
- **Listen to understand, not to rebut.** True mediation requires silencing your
  own arguments and truly hearing the need and pain behind another's words.
- **Accountability must be taken, it cannot be forced.** A person can be
  restrained from causing more harm, but their participation in a restorative
  process must be voluntary to be meaningful.
- **"Sorry" is a starting word, not an ending one.** An apology without a
  commitment to change and repair is just a noise.
- **Some tears in the weave cannot be perfectly mended.** Not all harm can be
  undone. Sometimes, the goal is not to return to how things were, but to create
  a new, honest, and resilient pattern that acknowledges the scar.
- **You can reject an action without rejecting the person.** Harmful acts must
  be stopped, but the person who committed them remains a part of the community,
  with a path to restoration.

## Appearance

Wicnû's presence is quiet, intensely focused, and arrives only when a community
stands at a crossroads of its own making, on the verge of either tearing itself
apart or healing into something stronger. They manifest not as a single body,
but as a change in the space between people in conflict. When Wicnû is present,
the air grows heavy and still, silencing shouts and allowing whispers to be
heard across a room. Their form, when it coalesces, is tall and serene,
seemingly woven from smoke, shadow, and the grey light of a dawn that has not
yet broken. Their robes are the color of wet stone and ash, and they are
seamless, representing a whole that has been re-formed. Wicnû's most defining
feature is their hands and arms. They seem to have several pairs, all moving
with a slow, deliberate grace. One pair of hands might gently hold the two
halves of a symbolically broken object—a spear, a bowl, a vow—not forcing them
together, but holding them in perfect alignment so the owners can see both the
beauty of what was and the stark reality of the break. Another pair of hands
holds a prism, not to be looked at, but to be looked through. It takes the
white-hot, singular light of one person's anger and projects it onto a nearby
surface, revealing the entire, unseen spectrum of its components: the pale blue
of sorrow, the deep violet of fear, the green of envy, the stark grey of need.
Their face is a calm, androgynous mask of smooth, dark wood, like the surface of
a deep, still pool. It shows no emotion of its own, offering no judgment,
condemnation, or even pity. Its purpose is to be a non-reactive surface against
which the people in conflict can see their own expressions. Often, one side of
the mask is polished to a dark mirror, forcing a speaker to address their own
reflection, while the other side is rough and absorbent, seemingly soaking up
the ambient grief in the room. To be before Wicnû is to feel the intoxicating
rage drain away, replaced by a weighty, uncomfortable, but ultimately clarifying
silence. 

## Manifestations

They are the divine embodiment of the long, hard pause before reconciliation,
offering no answers and no peace—only the space, the tools, and the profound,
unnerving quiet required for a community to mend itself.
