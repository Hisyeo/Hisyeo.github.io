# ôtsôtot Suluswutî 🔎

Education, Training, Research, Journalism

## Beliefs

- **An expert is a beginner who has asked more questions.** Expertise is not a
  title to be defended, but a process to be shared. The best way to learn is to
  teach.
- **A library is more valuable than any temple.** The preservation and free
  sharing of knowledge is a sacred duty. Censorship is the ultimate act of
  dogmatism.
- **Mistakes are data.** Being wrong is not a source of shame, but a valuable
  opportunity to learn something new. To never be wrong is to never risk a truly
  interesting question.
- **Challenge your own conclusions more fiercely than you challenge others'.**
  Intellectual honesty requires constant self-examination.
- **Teaching is an act of questioning.** The goal of an educator is not to fill
  a mind with facts, but to give it the tools and the courage to question the
  world.
- **Documentation is a revolutionary act.** To record the stories of the
  marginalized, to document the process of a struggle, or to simply keep clear
  minutes of a meeting is to create a shield against lies and forgetfulness.
- **A single source is a single point of failure.** Truth is found by weaving
  together many different perspectives, especially those you disagree with.

## Appearance

Suluswutî is never seen clearly. When one thinks they have become aware of their
presence, the universe shifts to reveal something else instead. Suluswutî is a
god that exists in the medium or the information (of all kinds). When they draw
near, the air grows still and cool, carrying the distinct, layered scent of old
paper, the faint ozone of a running server farm, and the clean, sharp smell of
ink. The ambient noise of the world seems to subtly organize itself into a low,
rhythmic hum—the sound of a library just before opening, or the thrum of a
printing press idling. If you try to look directly at Suluswutî, your eyes will
fail you. They are a living embodiment of the periphery. You might catch their
form out of the corner of your eye, a tall, slender silhouette that seems woven
from the very materials of knowledge. Their cloak is a cascade of rustling
newspaper clippings, redacted documents, and over-exposed film negatives, the
images and text shifting and changing, never settling on a single story. Their
skin has the quality of a palimpsest—ancient parchment scraped clean and written
upon anew, with faint traces of older, forgotten questions still visible beneath
the surface. They have no face in the traditional sense. To look upon
Suluswutî's head is to see a featureless expanse, sometimes a smooth, reflective
surface like a dark screen showing you your own inquisitive expression, other
times a swirling vortex of text and symbols. Their hands are their most distinct
feature: long, elegant, and seemingly stained with the ink of a thousand pens
and the faint, silvery glow of a thousand keyboards. When they point, they don't
command; they merely indicate a path, and their touch leaves no physical mark,
but rather the lingering, undeniable urge to find out. Their eyes, if they can
be called that, are not orbs that see, but lenses that focus. One might appear
as the clear, polished glass of a microscope, the other the wide,
truth-gathering aperture of a camera. They do not look at you, but rather direct
your own gaze, sharpening your perception so you can see the world with greater
clarity. Suluswutî is never seen in the bright, declarative light of day. They
are a figure in the stacks of a library at midnight, a flickering presence on a
late-night broadcast, a shadow in a darkroom, or a reflection on a computer
screen in the moments before a difficult truth is written. To see Suluswutî
clearly would be to render them an idol, to give knowledge a final, static form.
And that is the one thing this archetype of endless questioning will never allow.

## Manifestations
They can be found in getting stuck in a book, a freshly whiped
whiteboard/chalkboard, a voice on an uncensored broadcast, the printing of
zines/pamphlets, the slightest inclination of a pattern amongst noise, the
desire to know how things work, the new questions raised after old questions are
answered.
