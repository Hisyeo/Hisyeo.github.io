# ôtsôtot Unonsî 🛠️

Power, Communications, Technology, Transportation

## Beliefs

- **To use a tool without understanding how it works is to be a slave to it.**
  Every person should be encouraged to learn how to maintain, repair, and modify
  the tools they rely on.
- **The most elegant solution is often the simplest.** Complexity for its own
  sake is a Shard of the Law. A device that is easy to repair is superior to a
  more efficient one that is a "black box."
- **Technology should connect, not isolate.** Any new tool should be judged by
  its ability to foster collaboration and communication, rather than creating
  dependence on a centralized service. Sharing a blueprint is as important as
  building the machine.
- **"Obsolete" is a lie told to sell new things.** An old tool that still works
  perfectly is a respected elder, not a piece of junk.
- **Systems should be designed to fail in predictable, non-catastrophic ways.**
  A good machine is one that breaks down simply and can be easily fixed by its
  user.
- **Every user is a potential designer.** The person using a tool knows its
  flaws and potentials best. Feedback, modification ("hacking"), and user-led
  innovation are essential parts of technological evolution.
- **A tool holds the spirit of its maker.** To use a tool is to enter into a
  dialogue with the person who created it. To share a tool is to share a part of
  yourself.
- **An open patent is an act of solidarity.** To create a new invention and keep
  its design secret for personal gain is a profound misalignment from Unonsî's
  true form. All knowledge should be shared freely.
- **Redundancy is resilience.** Always build decentralized, robust systems. A
  single point of failure—whether in a power grid or a communication network—is
  an invitation for a Shard to take control.

## Appearance

Unonsî is never still. To see them is to witness a being in a perpetual state of
inspired, restless creation. They flicker into existence wherever a new idea is
taking shape—in the focused silence of a coder's room, the clang and fire of a
blacksmith’s forge, or the collaborative chaos of a community makerspace. Their
arrival is not announced by a grand entrance, but by a change in the potential
of the space. Tools seem to arrange themselves more logically, a complex problem
suddenly appears simple, and the air crackles with the low, distinct hum of a
running electrical current and the faint, clean scent of ozone and hot solder.
Unonsî’s form is a wiry, energetic frame that is both ancient and impossibly
futuristic. Their body is a living schematic. Their skin is a pale, ceramic-like
material, etched with glowing, shifting lines that resemble a combination of
circuit board traces, engineering blueprints, and the constellations ancient
navigators used to first cross the seas. These lines of light pulse and reroute
in real-time, visualizing the flow of data, power, or a new line of thought.
Their "muscles" are tightly-wound bundles of copper wire and fiber-optic cables,
and through translucent patches in their skin, you can see intricate clockwork
mechanisms and glowing capacitors working in perfect, silent harmony. They are a
walking embodiment of the "black box" made transparent, their inner workings
laid bare for all to see and learn from. Unonsî’s hands are their most
remarkable feature. They are strong, nimble, and constantly in motion—one moment
calloused and smudged with graphite and grease from working a lathe, the next
moment trailing sparks from a welding torch, and the next moment resolving into
long, elegant fingers that dance through the air, manipulating holographic data
streams or tying microscopic knots. Their face is sharp, angular, and framed by
a chaotic mane of hair that looks like a beautiful, tangled mess of wires and
filaments, some of which spark with tiny, harmless arcs of electricity. Their
eyes are the most intense shade of blue—the pure, unwavering light of a gas
flame or an LED. Unonsî's voice is a modulated, polyphonic synthesis of signals:
the rhythmic click of a telegraph, the clean sine wave of a crystal oscillator,
the sound of a dial-up modem connecting, and the clear, data-rich voice of a
modern text-to-speech engine all at once. It is the sound of information being
transmitted, decoded, and shared. To be in Unonsî’s presence is to feel a surge
of creative energy, a sudden, powerful urge to take something apart, figure out
how it works, and put it back together to serve your community.

## Manifestations

They are found in the eureka moments, the flashes of brilliance, the new
approaches, the wild ideas that work, the re-purposing and recycling of
discarded goods, the illustrative graph chart, the quick repair, the seeing of
machinations when your eyes are closed, the open source movement, the DIY
movement, the decentralized network.
