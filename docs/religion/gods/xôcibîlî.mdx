## Beliefs

- **You are not the same person you were yesterday, and that is a good thing.**
  Identity is a process, not a fixed point. Allow yourself to change, grow, and
  redefine yourself.
- **Solitude is as necessary as community.** You cannot bring a whole self to
  the circle if you have not spent time exploring your own inner world. A
  healthy community protects the right of its members to have time and space to
  themselves, recognizing that introspection and rest benefit the whole.
- **Your inner world is the one place you are truly sovereign.** Defend it
  fiercely. Do not let others dictate your feelings or your thoughts. Your
  identity is a story that you are both the author and the main character of.
- **Compare your journey only to your own past, not to another's present.** Envy
  is the fog that obscures your own path.
- **Be honest about what your story is and what you are facing.** It is not only
  acceptable, but honorable to clearly and honestly state your own needs and
  boundaries. This is preferable to dishonest "selflessness" that breeds
  resentment.
- **Your reflection is not your own.** The self you see in the mirror is shaped
  by the community that surrounds you. Therefore, building a better self
  requires building a better community, and vice-versa.

## Appearance

Xôcibîlî is the most subtle and personal of the gods, and they are never
perceived by a group. Their presence is a strictly solitary phenomenon, a quiet
dialogue between you and the uncharted territory of your own self. You do not
see Xôcibîlî in the outside world, but in the internal landscape. They manifest
when you are utterly alone, looking into a mirror or a still pool of water.
Their arrival is marked by a sudden, profound sense of self-awareness. It is the
moment you stop seeing your reflection as just a physical image and truly ask,
"Who is that?" When a form is perceived, it is your own, but rendered in a
symbolic medium. You might see your reflection as if it were carved from wood,
the grain telling the story of your growth and your hardships. You might see
yourself as a being of glass, showing all your beautiful, fragile, and
transparent layers. You might see yourself as a living anatomical chart, all
your complex internal mechanisms laid bare. The "face" of Xôcibîlî is the
ultimate focal point. It is always a perfect mirror, as the myths say, but it is
more than that. It is a mirror that does not simply show you what you look like,
but what you are in that moment. If you are hiding from yourself, the mirror
will be clouded with fog. If you are lying to yourself, it will be fractured
with a thousand tiny cracks. If you are accepting a difficult truth, it will be
perfectly, breathtakingly clear. Their voice is your own internal monologue, but
stripped of its usual anxieties and self-deceptions. It is your own thoughts,
spoken back to you with an unnerving clarity and honesty. To be with Xôcibîlî is
often uncomfortable. It is the act of radical self-inventory. It is the process
of untangling the threads of who you are from the threads of what others expect
you to be.

## Manifestations

They are the internal monologue, the personal journey, and the quiet comfort of
being truly alone with oneself.
