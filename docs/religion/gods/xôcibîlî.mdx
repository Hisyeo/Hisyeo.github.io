# ôtsôtot Xôcibîlî 🪞

Fashion, Therapy, Body Modification, Plastic Surgery

## Appearance

Xôcibîlî is the most subtle and personal of the gods, and they are never
perceived by a group. Their presence is a strictly solitary phenomenon, a quiet
dialogue between you and the uncharted territory of your own self. You do not
see Xôcibîlî in the outside world, but in the internal landscape. They manifest
when you are utterly alone, looking into a mirror or a still pool of water.
Their arrival is marked by a sudden, profound sense of self-awareness. It is the
moment you stop seeing your reflection as just a physical image and truly ask,
"Who is that?" When a form is perceived, it is your own, but rendered in a
symbolic medium. You might see your reflection as if it were carved from wood,
the grain telling the story of your growth and your hardships. You might see
yourself as a being of glass, showing all your beautiful, fragile, and
transparent layers. You might see yourself as a living anatomical chart, all
your complex internal mechanisms laid bare. The "face" of Xôcibîlî is the
ultimate focal point. It is always a perfect mirror, as the myths say, but it is
more than that. It is a mirror that does not simply show you what you look like,
but what you are in that moment. If you are hiding from yourself, the mirror
will be clouded with fog. If you are lying to yourself, it will be fractured
with a thousand tiny cracks. If you are accepting a difficult truth, it will be
perfectly, breathtakingly clear. Their voice is your own internal monologue, but
stripped of its usual anxieties and self-deceptions. It is your own thoughts,
spoken back to you with an unnerving clarity and honesty. To be with Xôcibîlî is
often uncomfortable. It is the act of radical self-inventory. It is the process
of untangling the threads of who you are from the threads of what others expect
you to be.

## Manifestations

They are the internal monologue, the personal journey, and the quiet comfort of
being truly alone with oneself.
