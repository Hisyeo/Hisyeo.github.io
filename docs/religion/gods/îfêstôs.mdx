# ôtsôtot Îfêstôs 🏭

Manufacturing, Materials, Construction

## Appearance

Îfêstôs's form is a testament to the materials of the world, shaped by endless,
purposeful labor. They are powerfully built, but not with the soft, sculpted
muscles of a showman. Theirs is the functional, undeniable strength of a being
designed for work. Their skin is like poured concrete, patched and weathered,
showing the faint lines of stress and the beautiful imperfections of a well-used
surface. Their muscles are coiled braids of steel cable and tightened ligaments
of worn leather, moving with a fluid efficiency that wastes no energy. Each scar
a story of a project completed, a structure raised. You can sometimes see a
dull, pulsing orange glow from within, the constant, steady heat of a deep and
internal forge that powers their every action. They are often shown with a
sledgehammer, not as a weapon, but as a tool for both deconstruction and
creation.

## Manifestations

They can be found in the sudden, satisfying heft of a tool in your hand; the
rhythmic, foundational sounds of work; the smell of freshly cut timber; the
cloud of dust from the extraction of raw materials, the heartbeat, the sounds of
hammers and anvils, the feeling of accomplishment from a big project being
completed.
