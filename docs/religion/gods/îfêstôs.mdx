# ôtsôtot Îfêstôs 🏭

Manufacturing, Materials, Construction

## Beliefs

- **The scar on a hand tells a better story than the jewel on a finger.** The
  marks of honest labor are signs of a life of creation and purpose.
- **The scar on a well-used tool is a mark of honor.** Signs of wear are a
  history of productive usage and should be celebrated, not hidden.
- **Measure twice, cut once.** Haste and carelessness disrespect the materials.
  The work is worthy of patience and focus.
- **Build things to last, not to be replaced.** Craftsmanship is a form of
  rebellion against a system of waste and consumption.
- **There is no such thing as "unskilled" labor.** All work requires knowledge,
  focus, and dignity, whether it is digging a ditch or carving a sculpture.
- **Materials have a voice.** A skilled worker listens to the wood, the stone,
  or the steel. The material itself will often suggest the best way to be
  shaped, and to force it against its nature is to create weakness.

## Appearance

Îfêstôs's form is a testament to the materials of the world, shaped by endless,
purposeful labor. They are powerfully built, but not with the soft, sculpted
muscles of a showman. Theirs is the functional, undeniable strength of a being
designed for work. Their skin is like poured concrete, patched and weathered,
showing the faint lines of stress and the beautiful imperfections of a well-used
surface. Their muscles are coiled braids of steel cable and tightened ligaments
of worn leather, moving with a fluid efficiency that wastes no energy. Each scar
a story of a project completed, a structure raised. You can sometimes see a
dull, pulsing orange glow from within, the constant, steady heat of a deep and
internal forge that powers their every action. They are often shown with a
sledgehammer, not as a weapon, but as a tool for both deconstruction and
creation.

## Manifestations

They can be found in the sudden, satisfying heft of a tool in your hand; the
rhythmic, foundational sounds of work; the smell of freshly cut timber; the
cloud of dust from the extraction of raw materials, the heartbeat, the sounds of
hammers and anvils, the feeling of accomplishment from a big project being
completed.
