# ôtsôtot Dimîtu 🌱

Environment, Land Usage, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry

## Beliefs

- **The health of the wolf is the health of the deer.** Predator and prey are
  partners in the same great dance. The entire cycle, including its violent and
  uncomfortable parts, is necessary for the health of the whole.
- **Leave a place better than you found it.** This applies to a campsite, a
  community, or the world itself.  Your presence should not diminish the life of
  the space you are in.
- **Death is the engine of life.** Composting, decay, and the predator's hunt
  are not evil; they are essential, creative, and sacred parts of the cycle.
- **Listen to what the land tells you.** The types of plants that grow, the flow
  of water, and the behavior of animals are all forms of knowledge. To impose a
  plan against the will of the land is an act of foolishness.
- **"Property" is a fiction.** You cannot own a piece of the ecosystem any more
  than you can own a person's life. We are momentary stewards of a system that
  will outlive us, never masters over it.
- **Human spaces are also ecosystems.** A city or a commune is not separate from
  nature. It should be treated as an ecosystem, with its own inputs, outputs,
  predator-prey dynamics, and need for biodiversity.
- **There is wisdom in weeds** The plants that grow in the cracks, the unwanted
  survivors, have the most to teach about resilience, adaptation, and survival
  in hostile conditions.
- **You are what you waste.** The waste a community produces is the truest
  measure of its relationship with the cycle of life and decay. A healthy
  community, like a healthy forest, has no "waste."

## Appearance

To see them is to see an avatar of the land itself, a localized, intensified
manifestation of the wild in all its glory and brutality. Their form changes
with the landscape and the turning of the seasons. In the heart of a spring
forest, Dimîtu might appear as a lithe and graceful being, their form woven from
young, supple branches and unfurling fern fronds. Their skin would be a mosaic
of vibrant green moss and smooth, damp bark, and their movements would be the
quick, silent grace of a deer. New life would cling to them: birds might nest in
the crook of their arm, and a trail of blooming wildflowers would follow their
footsteps. But in that same forest in autumn, Dimîtu becomes gnarled and somber.
Their form is of hardened, shedding bark and tangled, leafless vines. Their
color is the deep russet of decay, and their body is adorned with brilliant
fungi and shelf mushrooms that sprout from their knuckles and shoulders. Their
movement is the slow, patient sigh of a dying tree, and their presence is the
crisp, cold air that promises the coming frost. To look closely at Dimîtu’s form
is to see an entire ecosystem at work. Their skin is a living tapestry of
lichen, stone, and bark, crisscrossed by the shimmering trails of snails. Their
"veins" are not of blood, but of a dense mycelial network that pulses with a
faint, internal light, connecting them to every root and spore in the soil.
Colonies of insects live in the hollows of their body, and one might glimpse the
tiny, perfect skull of a field mouse nestled in the tangled roots that form
their feet. Dimîtu’s head and face are the most profound and unsettling aspect
of their appearance. There are no simple features, no human-like expression.
Instead, there is a visage of ancient, water-worn wood, a smooth, organic mask.
Where eyes would be, there are two deep hollows. From the right hollow emits the
soft, phosphorescent glow of fungal decay, a cold light that speaks of compost
and the breaking down of the old. From the left hollow springs the vibrant,
impossible green of a single, living sprout, reaching for the sun. In one gaze,
they hold the beginning and the end. Their voice is never a single sound, but
the layered chorus of the environment itself: the wind through the pines, the
rush of a river, the buzz of a dragonfly's wings, the distant cry of a hawk, and
the relentless, quiet munching of decomposers turning a fallen log back into
soil. To be in Dimîtu's presence is not necessarily comforting. It is to be made
profoundly aware of your own place within the food chain, to understand that you
are composed of the same materials as the wolf and the worm, the tree and the
stone.

## Manifestations

They are the whisper of the wind in the prairie grass, the quiet strength of an
ancient tree, the collective creaking of the forests, predators capturing prey,
prey escaping predators, the smells of flowers and decay.
