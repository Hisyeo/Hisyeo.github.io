# Ã´tsÃ´tot Bostet ðŸ«‚

Healthcare, Childcare, Funerary Services

## Appearance

Bostet has no single form as they are made of pure empathy. Instead, Bostet
"gathers" or "coalesces" in the spaces where care is needed most, borrowing from
the environment and the community to create a temporary vessel for their spirit.
When Bostet is near, there is a feeling deep inside and the sharp edges of the
world seem to soften. The air becomes warmer, imbued with the comforting,
layered scents of simmering soup, clean linens, old books, and the beeswax from
a thousand memorial candles. Their presence is a tangible weight, like the
reassuring pressure of a blanket being tucked around your shoulders. In moments
of great needâ€”at the bedside of the sick, in the wild chaos of a nursery, or
during a funerary vigilâ€”Bostet may coalesce into a visible form. This form is
never the same twice, but it is always a reflection of community. They may
appear as a being composed of a soft, moving patchwork of countless arms and
hands. There is the gnarled, gentle hand of a grandparent; the small, trusting
hand of a child; the steady, capable hand of a medic; and the consoling hand of
someone sharing in grief. Their body, if seen, is like a well-loved quilt, made
of countless fabrics, each patch a story of care: a piece of a babyâ€™s first
blanket, the worn flannel of a favorite shirt from someone long-gone, the
sterile blue of a surgical gown. Bostet has no face that could be carved or
painted. To look at their head is to see a soft, featureless bowl of warm, low
light, like a candle flame that doesn't flicker. It radiates a gentle heat and
casts no harsh shadows. At other times, their face is described as a silent
constellation of gentle, watching eyes of every shape and color, reflecting not
judgment or pity, but a profound, unwavering, and unconditional acceptance. To
be in the presence of Bostet is to feel the panic in your chest quiet, to feel
the anxious furrow of your brow ease. It is not an awesome or terrifying power,
but a deep, foundational one. It is the feeling of being truly seen, completely
held, and safely part of a whole. 

## Manifestations

They are the feeling of safety and belonging. You can hear Bostet in the quiet,
steady rhythm of a rocking chair, the soft hum of a lullaby, the gentle crackle
of a fire, or the profound, shared silence between those who grieve together.
