# Daily Practices & Rituals

There are many different activities that a practitioner might engage in.
Everyone is different in terms of how many daily or weekly activities they
involve themselves with.

## Prayers

Prayers are different from some religions because there is a greater
understanding that the universe is not always something that anyone can control,
even the gods. Prayers are usually oriented towards asking for guidance,
clarity, serenity, or the ability to find a trait inside oneself (or to receive
the aid of a fellow sapient being with the appropriate trait at the appropriate
time). Like some religions, prayers can be simple chants or mantras to help the
practitioner to achieve enlightenment or peace. Prayers are often said at a
shrine to help the practioner to feel connected to a consecrated place or
object. That being said, some prayers that are personal tools can be of great
use away from shrines.

## Shrines

Shrines to the gods can be found in work places, public places, and in homes.
They are sometimes devoted to one god, sometimes several and other times they
might be devoted to all of the gods. In a farming work place, there is often a
shrine to Dimîtu and in a factory, often a shrine to Îfêstôs but there is no
hard rule on what shrine should be present where.

### Consecration of a Shrine

A ritual to consecrate a shrine helps the practicioners to feel the connection
to the divine. It might seem silly but even if you struggle to connect
spiritually, it helps to frame your mind and prepare the way for fulfilling your
aims.

The first thing to do is a metaphorical clearing of the space of any remnants of
shards and echoes. In addition to greater clarity and a safer environment, this
also identifies the boundaries of the shrine. You can use any brush, literal or
figurative (preferably consecrated), to clear the space as you say this prayer:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo yôn sîkot mût cizî noyo mût boxô ôfo&emsp;<em>I brush myself and this space</em></p>
    <p>oxon xe li êo fonmot ôlê yogô kobût lôc ûn ûlzo ni yê kon hûkun ûn mîstu&emsp;<em>to remove all shards and their power of control and corruption</em></p>
    <p>oxon xe ondo boxô ôfo oxon ûlzo hoôs fôlnî yê ôtsôtot.&emsp;<em>to prepare this space for the free and chaotic energy of the gods.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Next within the space, light any candles, turn on any lamps or flashlighhts, and
burn some incense (if possible). Stimulating the senses helps to prepare you and
also helps guide the gods to your location.

After your senses have been awakened, it's time to officially announce your intent:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo/nûs xe li [somo], belêxu ôfo misli boxô kôdus mût [ôtsôtot] hoî fos xokûlû nîo hôn xe onkûol noyo/nûs hôn xe yundôû noyo/nûs.&emsp;<em>I/we, [name], hereby mark this space as a shrine to [god(s)] where they are invited to embrace and guide me/us.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Next, you must now designate the space that will be your shrine area. Using a
tool, visually draw the space as best you can. If you cannot reach a specific
side, then use a gesture to indicate that you are virtually drawing on that
side. The best tool to use for this purpose will either be a sacred object to
one of the gods of the shrine or any specific object that has been consecrated
or has residual spiritual energy of some kind. After finishing the delineation
of the space, say this prayer:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôfo li eloi yê boxô kôdus onô ûn hoî lîmîen yê ni li boxô oxon fos ôtsôtot dî kûsowî.&emsp;<em>This is the boundary of the shrine and within it, a place for [god(s)] to manifest.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Now that the shrine has been swept of shards and marked for divination, it is time to cleanse the sacred space.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>bôlfêlê xôboî li zôhûn sonkon kôî li êo sofîn.&emsp;<em>Salt is a vital nutrient and can purify.</em></p>
    <p>noyo li êo kôdus ôlê bôlfêlê ôfo oxon xe li êo mûfêû ôlê boxô kôdus ôfo.&emsp;<em>I bless this salt for cleansing this shrine.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Take ten pinches of salt and place them in a bowl of water, calling to each god's name as you do.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo xokûlû [ôtsôtot] oxon xe cûdo yoldûn hôn xe li êo kôdus ôlê bôlfêlê ôfo.&emsp;<em>I call upon [god] to assist me in blessing this salt</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Take the bowl of salty water and (either walking or gesturing in a smaller
space) sprinkle the water towards the shrine, the four cardinal directions
around the shrine as well as above, below, on yourself, between you and the
shrine, and lastly, over your shoulder (or someplace random away from the
shrine). While sprinkling, say this:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo li êo kôdus ôlê boxô ôfo tô ûlzo yê xîmu xôboî kôdus onô.&emsp;<em>I consecrate this shrine with the power of the blessed salt water.</em></p>
    <p>boxô onô hoî îbûdû li kôdus li sofîn li besol. ni kûu li gô lôîcôk.&emsp;<em>The shrine is now sacred, purified and sealed. So be it.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

If you have incense burning, you may also take a tool to help move the incense
around the shrine at this time, saying this:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>tô wôlik yê unon xôn û noyo helgo kon fôlnî yê ôtsôtot ûn kon isbulyol yê yogô kobût lôc yê fûtsûn kut onô.&emsp;<em>With this fragrant smoke, I honor the liberation of the gods and the Shattering of the First Law</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

The shrine is now ready although your first act will need to be consecrating
yourself for your interactions with it.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôlê noyo li êo kôdus û fôlnî noyo û tûu noyo û boxô kôdus ôfo.&emsp;<em>I am made sacred by my freedom, my will, and this shrine.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

That is it, your shrine is now consecrated and your link to the gods now made manifest.

## Festivals

There are many festivals; some for specific gods, some for all gods and some for heroes and history.
