# Sentences

The structure of morphemes, phrases & constituents.

## Morphosyntactics

Hîsyêô is considered an [isolating
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language) because all words
are a single morpheme. Some examples of isolating languages are
[Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language#Grammar),
[Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_grammar), and
[Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language#Grammar).

:::info What Is A Morpheme?

A [morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme) is a single unit of
meaning. In English, the word "cat" is a single morpheme but the word "cats" is
two morphemes: "cat" + "s" where the "s" is the morpheme that signifies that a
noun is plural. The word "intwined" is three morphemes, "in" for the meaning of
*interconnectedness*, "twine" for the verb that means to wrap or weave with a
twine-like object, and "ed" for the past participle of the verb (the modifier
form in past tense).

:::

Hîsyêô is also considered an [analytic
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_language), which means that
prepositions, particles and modifiers (grammatical relations) are separate words
that provide the additional meaning to words (instead of inflection or affixes
that are used in [synthetic
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_language)). English is mostly
an analytic language although there are some instances of affixes (such as
"-ed", "-ing", "-s"). There are no prefixes nor affixes in Hîsyêô, all meaning
is provided via separate words in known as prepositions and particles.

### Constituent Word Order

The order with which you setup a clause or sentence is called [constituent
order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_order#Constituent_word_orders).
Sentences are made up of verb and noun phrases that exist within prepositional
phrases. Let's ignore what prepositional phrases are available for the time
being and just zoom out and think about **subject** phrases (with noun phrases
within), **action** phrases (with verb phrases within), and **thematic** phrases
(with noun phrases within). Many languages require that you order your sentence
in a particular way such that each element along the way can be understood as a
specific part of a sentence. Some of the most prevalent constituent orders that
occur in natural languages include:
[subject-object-verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb_word_order),
[subject-verb-object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order),
[verb-second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V2_word_order), and
[topic-comment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_and_comment). In addition to
these sentence structure types, there also exists some languages that have no
strict word order. Instead they use morphological elements or particle words to
identify the different parts of the sentence. In these languages, the order in
which the parts of a sentence are provided may indicate the subject or theme of
a sentence.

Hîsyêô has a *mostly* free constituent order because all sentence parts are
marked by a preposition. The order of your sentence puts the first provided
element as the topic and each successive constituent as comments about the topic
in order of importance. That said, there are three irregularities that reduce
the freedom slightly. 

#### Irregularity #1: First Constituent Agent Elision

If the first constituent of a sentence is the agent, the preposition
(<HisyeoWord is='û'/>) can be **elided** (skipped) and the noun phrase provided
unmarked. However, if the agent's nucleus is a base verb, it must be preceded by
the preposition so that it's clear that you are referring to the noun derivation of
that verb.

Because of this elision rule, sentence structure does lean towards a preference
of
[subject-verb-object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order).

---

#### Irregularity #2: Verb-Object Syntactic Alignment

Direct objects are **always** introduced by a free-standing
[verb](./word_types/verbs.mdx). There is no way to provide a direct object
*before* providing the verb. Additionally, you can't follow a verb immediately
with another verb phrase (just like [you can't immediately follow any other
preposition by another preposition](./word_types/nouns#roles)).

This means that a sentence structure that mirrors the English [passive
voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_voice) is not strictly supported.
However, there is a way to raise the object to the subject position by providing
the object in the subject preposition and supplying the agent and verb in a
subject complement subordinate clause.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>zowo hônyo côt cênbô tô hokôlî nîo ogolol noyo.&emsp;<em>A bear is biting me.</em></p>
    <p>noyo li fos zowo hônyo côt cênbô tô hokôlî nîo ogolol.&emsp;<em>I am being bitten by a bear.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

#### Irregularity #3: Verb-Connector Syntactic Alignment

If a verb is preceded by a [connector](./word_types/connectors), it is
interpreted as the noun derivation. Only when followed by a preposition particle
does the connector signify a new sentence.

This means that there's some difficulty when expressing compound sentences that
hinge on a change in verb but there are ways around it.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû fôlun xe dênêmêk kon xobo yodo kon bôkôfoc ko.&emsp;<em>"Do you want to practice hitting or blocking?"</em></p>
    <p>nîo buswen mokon yodo îskô ko.&emsp;<em>"Do they need food or drink?"</em>&emsp;<small>(Instead of "Do they need to eat or to drink?")</small></p>
    <p>mênyûu onô bi ôhêl bi môcîbo kelo kelo kôto kôto hoî bitûn mûlû. &emsp;<em>"The kids were playing and talking all night."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Null Constituents

When an independent clause lacks a constituent like an agent/causer or
patient/causee, such a clause is said to have a **null subject**. This means
that the subject can be inferred through the surrounding sentence, prior
sentences or any other contextual cues.

When an indendent clause lacks a verbal constituent but contains a subject
constituent and other thematic constituents,the clause is said to have a **null
copula**. This means that the relationship between the subject and the thematic
constituents can be inferred through the surrounding sentence, prior sentences
or any other contextual cues.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû (li gô) hoî ulyô ko.&emsp;<em>Are you there?</em></p>
    <p>(noyo) (li gô) hoî ôfo.&emsp;<em>I am here.</em></p>
    <p>(nîmû) (li gô) hoî zik?&emsp;<em>Where are you?</em></p>
    <p>(noyo) (li gô) bi cônkôk hoî ôfo.&emsp;<em>Right here.</em></p>
    <p>(nîmû) (li gô) til zik dên noyo?&emsp;<em>Why are you against me?</em></p>
    <p>(noyo) (li gô) nênko fos noyo kôî li gô (misli ulyô).&emsp;<em>Because I can be.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

In the last sentence, the subordinate clause inside of the <HisyeoWord is='nênko'/> preposition
phrase could not have its verb elided because we needed to apply the epistemic verb particle.

### Phrase Word Order

Each constituent has a preposition and a phrase (either an adverb or a noun).
Within any given phrase there is always one word that is the main contents of
that phrase. This is known as the
[nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(linguistics)) of the phrase. In
Hîsyêô, the nucleus is the **first** word in a phrase. Regardless of whether the
base type of the word is a verb, noun, or adjective, the word always takes on
the form that the preposition particle demands. The nucleus of a verb phrase is
the direct object (a noun), the nucleus of a subject or semantic phrase is a
noun. The nucleus of a manner/material phrase is an adverb. Hîsyêô technically
has a nucleus in the middle of a phrase because
[determiners](./word_types/determiners.mdx) go to the *left* of the nucleus and
[adjectives](./word_types/modifiers.mdx) to the *right*.

### Subject Complements & Existence

The particle <HisyeoWord is='li'/> is a special preposition that marks a subject
complement. It links a subject to a description (noun or modifier) or state.

- **Not a Verb:** <HisyeoWord is='li'/> is a preposition, not a verb. It cannot take verb modifiers or be converted into a noun.
- **Existential:** When no subject is provided, <HisyeoWord is='li'/> implies "There is" or "It is".

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>li môtô.&emsp;<em>There is fire.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**The Copula:** The concept of existence/location (<HisyeoWord is='gô'/>) is
treated as a noun concept, not a verb. Therefore, it requires li to function as
a predicate.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo (li gô) hoî niwos.&emsp;<em>I am [existing] at home.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Continuous Description:** If a subject is already established in a previous
clause, <HisyeoWord is='li'/> can be used to add further description without
restating the subject.

## Sentence Types

### Simple

A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause with no dependent
clauses.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo mokon sî yoûtî kûôxi.&emsp;<em>He ate some fruit.</em></p>
    <p>û oûtô gîsgûl onô li kobût.&emsp;<em>The bicycle is broken.</em></p>

</HisyeoTabs>

### Compound

A compound sentence consists of multiple independent clauses with no dependent
clauses. These clauses are joined together using conjunctions.

<HisyeoTabs>

    <p>nûs kôî li nô mût gubuyo kon mokon yodo û nûs kôî côûfon hoî niwos nûs.&emsp;<em>We can go to the restuarant or make dinner at home.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Complex

A complex sentence consists of one independent clause and at least one dependent
clause.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo nocîdo sî kelo nênko fos nîo li sî bîcûon.&emsp;<em>He lost the game because he was tired.</em></p>
    <p>nênko fos nîo li sî bîcûon, û nîo nocîdo sî kelo.&emsp;<em>Because she was tired, she lost the game.</em></p>
    <p>kûu xokûlû noyo hôn fos nîmû li nô lôtfen.&emsp;<em>Please call me, if you go.</em></p>
    <p>hôn fos nîmû li nô, kûu xokûlû noyo lôtfen.&emsp;<em>If you go, please call me.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Compound-Complex

A compound–complex sentence (or complex–compound sentence) consists of multiple
independent clauses, at least one of which has at least one dependent clause.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo li sî nô til xe ogolol ônî dûngo nênko fos ondo sî côûfon bitûn til kon mokon, bînê zowo mokon sî côûfon nîo.&emsp;<em>He went to grab a fork because dinner was ready to eat and then the dog ate his meal.</em></p>
    <p>noyo sûko yôk ûnfûnô lêkin û noyo ke mokon ni hôn fos noyo bît buswen (xe tûu ni).&emsp;<em>I don't like vegetables but I'll eat them if I have to.</em></p>
    <p>umo wohî onô xe sûn dûî zomo îlê xokôn cok, xokûlû sî noyo hoî hêlxun eswen bînê noyo xokûlû nîo bi dukwêlit.&emsp;<em>The woman from two blocks down called me earlier so I called her back.</em></p>
