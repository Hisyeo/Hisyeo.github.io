# Punctuation

The pauses of speech and how to write them.

In Hîsyêô, punctuation is not just for grammatical organization; it is a direct
instruction for prosody (the rhythm and pauses of speech). When reading aloud,
every mark corresponds to a specific length of silence or intonation change

## Sentence Terminators

### Period

| Latin | Abugida                                   | Syllabary                                   |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| .     | <HisyeoText kind='abugida'>.</HisyeoText> | <HisyeoText kind='syllabary'>.</HisyeoText> |

Periods are used to end sentences.  In spoken Hîsyêô, this is longer pause than
a comma and a shorter pause than a semicolon.

### Question Marks

| Latin | Abugida                                     | Syllabary                                     |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ¿ ?   | <HisyeoText kind='abugida'>?</HisyeoText>   | <HisyeoText kind='syllabary'>?</HisyeoText>   |

In the latin script, question marks are placed surrounding a sentence that is a
question. In the other scripts, there's no additional preceding mark. These
marks isn't strictly necessary for the sentence to be interpreted as a question
but it indicates that the speech pattern is one of a rising question intonation.

## Exclamation Point
There is no exclamation point in Hîsyêô. If you want to indicate that a sentence
is aggressive or emotional, use the <HisyeoWord is='ze'/> sentence ending
particle. If you want to indicate that a sentence is delivered with shock,
surprise, dismay, or excitement, use the <HisyeoWord is='foxo'/> sentence ending
particle.

## Pauses & Separators

### Comma

| Latin | Abugida                                   | Syllabary                                   |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ,     | <HisyeoText kind='abugida'>,</HisyeoText> | <HisyeoText kind='syllabary'>,</HisyeoText> |

Commas are used to end sub-clauses or for long lists.  In spoken Hîsyêô, this is
the shortest pause used. They are strictly reserved for these grammatical
purposes and cannot be used in the more free way that you might be used to from
some native languages. If you think you need a comma for an emphatic pause, use
the em dash.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hôn fos nîmû li nô, kûu xokûlû noyo.&emsp;<em>If you go, call me.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Em Dash

| Latin | Abugida                                   | Syllabary                                   |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| —     | <HisyeoText kind='abugida'>—</HisyeoText> | <HisyeoText kind='syllabary'>—</HisyeoText> |

Anytime you would use a comma or other punctuation to indicate a pause that
isn't strictly grammatically required, use the em dash. Commas have a specific
usage in Hîsyêô which is best preserved (even though the spoken—or rather,
*un*spoken—effect is the same).  In spoken Hîsyêô, the em dash is either an
abrupt pause which upsets the natural prosody of the speeech or it fits
rhythmically in the pattern of speech as a rest.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo—bi hokîkî—li sî gô hoî ulyô.&emsp;<em>I—truthfully—was there.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


### Semicolon

| Latin | Abugida                                   | Syllabary                                   |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ;     | <HisyeoText kind='abugida'>;</HisyeoText> | <HisyeoText kind='syllabary'>;</HisyeoText> |

Semicolons are used to combine two independent sentences into one to signify
that they have some relationship. In spoken Hîsyêô, this is only a slightly
shorter pause than a period. You may want to use the normally-elided causer/agent marker to help
improve understanding of the independence of the clauses but it's not strictly necessary.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo li bîcûon; (û) nîo li sî conzodo.&emsp;<em>He is tired; he went to sleep.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Colon

| Latin | Abugida                                   | Syllabary                                   |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| :     | <HisyeoText kind='abugida'>:</HisyeoText> | <HisyeoText kind='syllabary'>:</HisyeoText> |

Colons are used to indicate large lists.  In spoken Hîsyêô, this is a long pause
and a slight intonation change to the word just prior to the colon.


<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nûs buswen uyo ôfo: kûôxi, oksûn, ûn yoûtî xîmu.&emsp;<em>We need these things: fruit, meat, and some water.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


## Quotation Marks

| Latin | Abugida                                       | Syllabary                                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| “ ”   | <HisyeoText kind='abugida'>« »</HisyeoText>   | <HisyeoText kind='syllabary'>« »</HisyeoText>   |

Quotation marks are used to surround direct speech. In spoken Hîsyêô, sometimes
there is a short pause before and after to indicate a direct quote.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo kôto sî "bîolî" mût noyo.&emsp;<em>He said "hello" to me.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Proper Name Marks

| Latin | Abugida                                       | Syllabary                                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| “ ”   | <HisyeoText kind='abugida'>‹ ›</HisyeoText>   | <HisyeoText kind='syllabary'>〈  〉</HisyeoText>   |

In the Latin script, a capital letter is used to indicate a proper name and it
will always be directly after a word (the nucleus) or phrase that indicates what
that name is for.  In spoken Hîsyêô, there is a slight pause and often an
intonation change. If the nucleus is a single word, the stress can often be
suppressed completely and shifted over to the proper name.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>sinsî Xikogô&emsp;<em>City [of] Chicago</em></p>
    <p>umo Zon&emsp;<em>Person [named] John</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
