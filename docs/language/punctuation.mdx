# Punctuation

## Comma
Commas are used to end clauses.  In spoken Hîsyêô, this is the shortest pause
used.

## Period
Periods are used to end sentences.  In spoken Hîsyêô, this is longer pause than
a comma and a shorter pause than a semicolon.

## Semicolon
Semicolons are used to combine two independent sentences into one to signify
that they have some relationship. In spoken Hîsyêô, this is only a slightly
shorter pause than a period.

## Colon
Colons are used to indicate large lists.  In spoken Hîsyêô, this is a long pause
and a slight intonation change to the word just prior to the colon.

## Em Dash
Anytime you would use a comma or other punctuation to indicate a pause, use the
em dash. Commas have a specific usage in Hîsyêô which is best preserved (even
though the spoken—or rather, *un*spoken—effect is the same).  In spoken Hîsyêô,
this either an abrupt pause which upsets the natural prosody of the speeech or
it fits rhythmically in the pattern of speech as a rest.

## Question Marks
Question marks are placed surrounding a sentence that is a question. This isn't
necessary for the sentence to be interpreted as a question but it indicates that
the speech pattern is one of a rising question intonation.

## Quotation Marks
Quotation marks are used to surround direct speech. In spoken Hîsyêô, sometimes
there is a short pause before and after to indicate a direct quote.

## Proper Name Marks
In the Latin script, a capital letter is used to indicate a proper name and it
will always be directly after a word (the nucleus) or phrase that indicates what
that name is for.  In spoken Hîsyêô, there is a slight pause and often an
intonation change. If the nucleus is a single word, the stress can often be
suppressed completely and shifted over to the proper name.

## Exclamation Point
There is no exclamation point in Hîsyêô. If you want to indicate that a sentence
is aggressive or emotional, use the <HisyeoWord is='ze'/> sentence ending
particle. If you want to indicate that a sentence is delivered with shock,
surprise, dismay, or excitement, use the <HisyeoWord is='foxo'/> sentence ending
particle.
