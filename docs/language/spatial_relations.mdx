# Spatial Relations

How to relate the position of our surroundings & objects.

Hîsyêô does not use specific prepositions for concepts like "inside," "under,"
or "behind." Instead, it uses a **Locative Nucleus Construction**.

## The Structure

To describe a specific position relative to an object, you use the generic
location preposition <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> (at/in/on), followed by a content
word representing the specific position (top, bottom, inside) acting as the
nucleus, followed by the possessive connector <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> (of).

### Formula:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hoî&emsp;<strong>+</strong><span>&emsp;[Position Word]&emsp;</span><strong>+</strong>&emsp;yê&emsp;<strong>+</strong><span>&emsp;[Reference Object]</span></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

<em>Literal translation: "At the [top/bottom/inside] of the object."</em>

## Position Words

While these words may belong to other word classes (such as modifiers or verbs), when placed in this specific syntactic slot, they function as the nucleus of the phrase to define location.

| English | Hîsyêô | Usage Example | Literal Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Top / Summit       | <HisyeoWord is='solwôc'/> | <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> <HisyeoWord is='solwôc'/> <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> <HisyeoWord is='niwos'/> | At the top of the house |
| High / Above       | <HisyeoWord is='cên'/> | <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> <HisyeoWord is='cên'/> <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> <HisyeoWord is='niwos'/> | At the high-point of the house |
| Bottom / Base      | <HisyeoWord is='tûndû'/> | <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> <HisyeoWord is='tûndû'/> <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> <HisyeoWord is='niwos'/> | At the bottom of the house |
| Low / Below        | <HisyeoWord is='sêl'/> | <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> <HisyeoWord is='sêl'/> <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> <HisyeoWord is='niwos'/> | At the low-point of the house |
| Inside / Interior  | <HisyeoWord is='lîmîen'/> | <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> <HisyeoWord is='lîmîen'/> <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> <HisyeoWord is='dibo'/> | At the inside of the box |
| Outside / Exterior | <HisyeoWord is='wokto'/> | <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> <HisyeoWord is='wokto'/> <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> <HisyeoWord is='dibo'/> | At the outside of the box |
| Front / Anterior   | <HisyeoWord is='fôhon'/> | <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> <HisyeoWord is='fôhon'/> <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> <HisyeoWord is='nîmû'/> | At the front of you |
| Back / Posterior   | <HisyeoWord is='soden'/> | <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> <HisyeoWord is='soden'/> <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> <HisyeoWord is='nîmû'/> | At the back of you |
| Side / Flank       | <HisyeoWord is='sôbo'/> | <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> <HisyeoWord is='sôbo'/> <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> <HisyeoWord is='oûtô'/> | At the side of the car |

## Linear Prepositions

In addition to the "free" spatial words above, Hîsyêô has two specific
prepositions used for describing linear relationships in both space and time.
These are used when the relationship is sequential rather than purely
positional.

| Preposition | Meaning | Usage |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| <HisyeoWord is='ilik'/> | Preceding / Before | Used for things that come before the reference point in a line or sequence. |
| <HisyeoWord is='cihôû'/> | Succeeding / After | Used for things that come after the reference point in a line or sequence. |

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo li totsi ilik noyo.&emsp;<em>He stands preceding me (in line).</em></p>
    <p>nûs ke li gô cihôû lono ôfo.&emsp;<em>We will be [there] after today.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Additional Examples

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p><strong>The cat is under the table.</strong>&emsp;mocko (li gô) hoî tûndû yê mîêbil.&emsp;<em>(The cat is located at the bottom of the table.)</em></p>
    <p><strong>Wait inside the car.</strong>&emsp;kûu motsi hoî lîmîen yê oûtô.&emsp;<em>(Wait at the interior of the car.)</em></p>
    <p><strong>He stood in front of me.</strong>&emsp;nîo li totsi hoî fôhon yê noyo.&emsp;<em>(He stood at the front of me.)</em></p>
