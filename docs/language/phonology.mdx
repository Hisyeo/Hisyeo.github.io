# Phonology

How the sounds of the language are mapped to syllables.

## Phonemes

### Consonants

Hîsyêô has 16 consonants and 1 null consonant which is necessary for the
alphasyllabary but you can optionally include a ⟨ ꞌ ⟩ character in Latin
representations too.

- For all phonemes, there is some flexibility in the position, voicing,
  aspiration, etc. to accommodate learners who speak languages that may
  pronounce these sounds differently
- Words beginning with a vowel can begin with or without a glottal stop [ʔ]
  pronounced, at the discretion of the speaker.
- The coda-/n/ can be realized as (1) a nasalization of the preceding vowel, (2)
  an allophonic sound related to the position of the following syllable, i.e.
  /n/ → [m, n, ɲ, ŋ, ɴ] based on shared features with the following onset, or
  (3) coda-/n/ can just be pronounced as a standard [n] in all places.
- The coda-/k/ is often realized without any audible release [k̚]
- When coda-/k/ is preceding /y w/, then it is realized as a back fricative [x]
- The coda-/t/ is often realized without any audible release [t̚]
- When coda-/t/ is preceding /y w/, then it can be realized with aspiration [tʰ]
  and the onsets can become voiceless [y̥ w̥]
- When coda-/t/ is preceding /s/, then it can be realized as an affricate [ʦ]
- When coda-/t͡ʃ/ is preceding /t d n/, it can become a simpler fricative [ʃ ɕ].
- The coda-/s/ is often realized as [z] in word final position
- The /h/ is often realized as [ç] when preceding /i/ or /u/ vowels.


### Vowels

The [syllabary](./orthography.mdx#hîsyokûî) has unique versions for each
syllable (onset, nucleus, coda). The null onset glyphs are shown below.

| Syllabary                       | Abugida                       | Latin                       | IPA | Transliteration Sources                             |
| :-----------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :-------------------------: | --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| <span kind="syllabary">a</span> | <span kind="abugida"> </span> | <span kind="latin">o</span> | /ɑ/ | open-back unrounded vowels: a ɑ ɐ                   |
| <span kind="syllabary">o</span> | <span kind="abugida">ı</span> | <span kind="latin">ô</span> | /o/ | open-back-close-back rounded vowels: ɶ ɒ ɞ ɔ o ɵ    |
| <span kind="syllabary">j</span> | <span kind="abugida">ȷ</span> | <span kind="latin">i</span> | /ɪ/ | central near-close-mid vowels: ɪ ʏ ɨ ɘ              |
| <span kind="syllabary">i</span> | <span kind="abugida">ɟ</span> | <span kind="latin">î</span> | /i/ | front close vowels: i y                             |
| <span kind="syllabary">q</span> | <span kind="abugida">ɿ</span> | <span kind="latin">e</span> | /ɛ/ | front/central unrounded near-open-mid vowels: ɛ ɜ æ |
| <span kind="syllabary">e</span> | <span kind="abugida">ʇ</span> | <span kind="latin">ê</span> | /e/ | front close-mid vowels: e ø                         |
| <span kind="syllabary">r</span> | <span kind="abugida">ʃ</span> | <span kind="latin">u</span> | /ʌ/ | open-mid back unrounded vowels: ʌ ə ɜ ɐ ɤ           |
| <span kind="syllabary">u</span> | <span kind="abugida">ʄ</span> | <span kind="latin">û</span> | /u/ | back close rounded vowels: u ʉ ʊ ɯ                  |

## Phonotactics

Syllable structure is (C)V(C) where only these codas are allowed:
- /k/
- /t/
- /t͡ʃ/ ~ / t͡ɕ/
- /s/
- /n/
- /l/ ~ /ɫ/

All codas cannot be followed by their same phoneme as the onset of the next
syllable. There are also some additional instances where certain onsets are not
allowed following certain codas:
- coda-/k/ cannot be followed by onset-/g/
- coda-/t/ cannot be followed by onset-/d/ or onset-/ʃ/
- coda-/ t͡ɕ/ cannot be followed by onset-/s/
- coda-/s/ cannot be followed by onset-/ʃ/
- onset-/h/ can only be preceded by coda-/n/

Strong vowels are slightly geminated compared to the weak vowels:

|         |               Strong               |        Weak         |
| ------- | :--------------------------------: | :-----------------: |
| Abugida | (null), ⟨ı ⟩, ⟨ʄ⟩, ⟨ɟ⟩, ⟨ʇ⟩ | ⟨ʃ⟩, ⟨ȷ⟩, ⟨ɿ⟩ |
| Latin   | ⟨o⟩, ⟨ô⟩, ⟨û⟩, ⟨i⟩, ⟨ê⟩  | ⟨u⟩, ⟨i⟩, ⟨e⟩ |

## Prosody

Emphasis is a slight pitch prominence and increased loudness. Length is only
influenced by vowel strength. In two syllable words, the stress is placed on the
first syllable regardless of the vowels present. In three syllable words, stress
is placed on the second syllable if the first vowel is weak and the second
syllable is strong. Otherwise, stress remains on the first syllable.

Either an unvoiced pause or a voiced clause ender are used to mark the ending of
a ta- or te-clause. Sentence endings are also just slightly longer pauses and/or
sentence ender particles.

## Word restrictions

All of the dictionary words of Hîsyêô (not including proper nouns or loanwords,
etc.) are either one-, two- or three-syllables long. There are no minimal pairs
that contrast using any “conflicting phonemes”.

### Consonant Conflicts
- /b/ with /f/ and /d/
- /k/ with /h/ and /g/
- /g/ with /h/, /k/, and /d/
- /t/ with /d/, / t͡ɕ/, /s/, and /n/
- / t͡ɕ/ with /d͡ʒ/, /t/
- /d/ with /t/, /g/, /d͡ʒ/, and /b/
- /d͡ʒ/ with / t͡ɕ/ and /d/
- /s/ with /f/, / t͡ɕ/, and /t/
- /x/ with /s/ and /f/, and / t͡ɕ/
- /f/ with /s/, /x/, /b/, and /w/
- /h/ with Ø, /k/, and /g/
- /m/ with /n/
- /n/ with /m/
- Ø (null onset) with /h/, /k/, and /g/
- /w/ with Ø, /f/, and /l/
- /l/ with /j/ and /w/
- /j/ with Ø and /l/

### Vowel Conflicts
- /ɑ/ with /ə/ and /i/           
- /æ/ with /i/ and /ə/    
- /ı / with /ɑ/, /i/, and /e/
- /ə/ with /ɑ/, /ɔ/, and /æ/
- /ɔ/ with /u/ and /ə/
- /e/ with /i/ and /i/
- /i/ with /e/ and /i/
- /u/ with /ɔ/

This means that two words that differ by one sound cannot have any of these
conflicting phonemes as the differing sounds. For example, since <HisyeoWord
is='yôcno'/> is a Hîsyêô word, there are no words like **yôzmo**, **yôzto** or
**ôzno** also in the language because they differ by one phoneme that conflicts
with a phoneme in <HisyeoWord is='yôcno'/>.
