# Orthography

The scripts used to write the language.

## Writing Systems

There are three writing systems that can be used with Hîsyêô: one that uses
Latin encoding characters, one that uses Latin-extended encoding characters, and
a heavily modified version of Kikakui. Here's an example sentence in Hîsyêô that
covers much of the possible syllables (not a complete pangram due to the
syllabic writing systems):

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>zowo hônyo cûtî bûlo fîkî ulyô socok xe kôs zoston mût boxô dîzel yê zowo legêfû onô.&emsp;<em>The quick brown fox starts to jump over the lazy dog</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Check out the [phonology](../language/phonology) page for details about which
phonemes are available.

### Letin

Using most of the standard alphabetic characters that are employed by many
European languages, the **Letin** orthography is the one that may be most
familiar to most people due to the wide usage of Latin orthographies in many
large primary and secondary language users.  However, due to the larger than
normal vowel distinctions and the phonological transcription, there are more
vowels than the Latin encoding has vowel characters. Due to this, usage of
[diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic) is necessary.

:::tip Diacritics

There are two common diacritics used: the circumflex and the diaresis. This site
used to be written using the diaresis (and one vowel had a single dot ⟨İ i⟩
whereas the non-diacritical version was dotless ⟨I ı⟩. This was changed to a
circumflex ⟨Î î⟩ due to some possible misinterpretations of vowels and because the
circumflex is both featural and often is used for similar changes in natural
languages. That being said, there is only one diacritic used in the orthography
so which one you use isn't really a major concern. Learning the vowel pairs
should be done separately from a written association. 

:::

### Letin-Hîsyokûî

There is another Latin encoding that uses characters that are less-commonly
representative of vowels. While this is primarily to allow a special font to be
used to write the Hîsyokûî script without any changes to your computer or mobile
device's keyboard settings, it also could become the standard approach for
usernames, web domains, or other applications that don't work well with
diacritics.

### Hîskonû

Based on the abugida writing system
[Likanu](https://en.kokanu.com/reference/pronunciation.html) created for
[Kokanu](https://en.kokanu.com). However, due to the large phoneme inventory,
there were many modifications to make it fit. This system uses symbols that are
available in some large unicode-supporting fonts but there may be some
compatibility issues. Additionally, kerning is usually not well-supported
because these characters aren't commonly used together in the way that this
system uses them. The example below is making use of Noto Sans but Charis SIL
and Gentium Plus are two other supporting fonts.

### Hîsyokûî

The official and primary writing system of Hîsyêô is **Hîsyokûî**. Based on the
syllabic writing system
[Kikakui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mende_Kikakui_script) created by Mohamed
Turay in 1917. Due to the larger phoneme inventory of Hîsyêô compared to Mende,
only seventeen glyphs were selected to form the base consonants of Hîsyokûî. The
medials (vowels) are extra strokes/flourishes added to the base consonant.
Additionally, the vowel diacritic is present in this script as well to
differentiate between the vowel pairs. Lastly, the script uses a top diacritic
to represent codas similar to the Hîskonû script. The video content will be done
only in the Hîsyokûî script but the website content is presented in all three
scripts.

## Numerals

Hîsyêô uses the standard Arabic numerals like many languages but it also has
its own number system for formal usage. This system is a hybrid of ancient
Etruscan/Roman symbols and native Hîsyêô letter-forms. It is an
additive-subtractive system used to represent dates and formal numbers.

### The Glyphs

The system uses seven symbols. The lower values (`I`, `V`, `X`) connect Hîsyêô to the ancient human past (the "Long History"), while the higher values (`T`, `F`, `B`, `E`) are derived from Hîsyêô vocabulary.

| Value | Latin Symbol | Origin / Etymology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **I** | Ancient tally mark (Finger) |
| **5** | **V** | Ancient hand symbol (Palm) |
| **10** | **X** | Ancient double-hand symbol |
| **50** | **T** | Derived from <HisyeoWord is='tîû'/> (5) |
| **100** | **F** | Derived from <HisyeoWord is='fîyên'/> (100) |
| **500** | **B** | Visual hybrid of **F** and **E** |
| **1000** | **E** | Derived from <HisyeoWord is='elfû'/> (1000) |

:::warning Little e versus Big E
The uppercase **E** is only used for the subtraction rule, otherwise lowecase **e** is used, as described below.
:::

### The Magnitude Suffix (The Echo)

To represent numbers larger than 999, you attach the suffix **e** (from *Elfû*, thousand) to the base number. This acts as a multiplier of 1,000.

| Value | Suffix | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1,000** | **e** | ×1,000 (Thousands) |
| **1,000,000** |**e**<strong><sup>II</sup></strong> / **e²** | ×1,000,000 (Millions) |
| **1,000,000,000** | **e**<strong><sup>III</sup></strong> / **e³** | ×1,000,000,000 (Billions) |

:::info Arabic Superscripts or Formatting

You might be wondering why Arabic numeral superscripts are allowed. If you are
using a word processor or HTML, you should the standard superscript formatting
and use the proper numeral symbols. For environments that don't offer
superscripts, use the unicode arabic numerals.

:::

### Notation Rules

1.  Break the number into chunks of three digits (Millions, Thousands, Ones).
2.  Write each chunk using the standard additive/subtractive rules for 1-999.
3.  Add **e** to the thousands chunk, and **e<sup>II</sup>** to the millions chunk.
4.  Join them together.

#### Subtraction Rule (4s and 9s)
Standard subtraction applies. A power of 10 (I, X, F) can only subtract from the next two highest symbols (e.g., I subtracts from V and X, but not T).

| Subtracting | From (Next 2) | Result | Value |
|-------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| I (1)       | V (5)         | IV     | 4     |
| I (1)       | X (10)        | IX     | 9     |
| X (10)      | T (50)        | XT     | 40    |
| X (10)      | F (100)       | XF     | 90    |
| F (100)     | B (500)       | FB     | 400   |
| F (100)     | E (1000)      | FE     | 900   |

:::warning 900 versus 1000
Watch out for the difference between 900 (**FE**) from 1000 (**Ie**).
