# Orthography

There are three writing systems that can be used with Hîsyêô: one that uses
Latin encoding characters, one that uses Latin-extended encoding characters, and
a heavily modified version of Kikakui. Here's an example sentence in Hîsyêô that
covers much of the possible syllables (not a complete pangram due to the
syllabic writing systems):

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>zowo hônyo cûtî bûlo fîkî ulyô socok xe kôs zoston mût boxô dîzel yê zowo legêfû onô.&emsp;<em>The quick brown fox starts to jump over the lazy dog</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Letin

Using most of the standard alphabetic characters that are employed by many
European languages, the **Letin** orthography is the one that may be most
familiar to most people due to the wide usage of Latin orthographies in many
large primary and secondary language users.  However, due to the larger than
normal vowel distinctions and the phonological transcription, there are more
vowels than the Latin encoding has vowel characters. Due to this, usage of
[diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic) is necessary.

:::tip Diacritics

There are two common diacritics used: the circumflex and the diaresis. This site
used to be written using the diaresis (and one vowel had a single dot ⟨İ i⟩
whereas the non-diacritical version was dotless ⟨I ı⟩. This was changed to a
circumflex due to some possible misinterpretations of vowels and because the
circumflex is both featural and often is used for similar changes in natural
languages. That being said, there is only one diacritic used in the orthography
so which one you use isn't really a major concern. Learning the vowel pairs
should be done separately from a written association.

## Letin-Hîsyokûî

There is another Latin encoding that uses characters that are less-commonly
representative of vowels. While this is primarily to allow a special font to be
used to write the Hîsyokûî script without any changes to your computer or mobile
device's keyboard settings, it also could become the standard approach for
usernames, web domains, or other applications that don't work well with
diacritics.

## Hîskonû

Based on the abugida writing system
[Likanu](https://en.kokanu.com/reference/pronunciation.html) created for
[Kokanu](https://en.kokanu.com). However, due to the large phoneme inventory,
there were many modifications to make it fit.

## Hîsyokûî

The official and primary writing system of Hîsyêô is **Hîsyokûî**. Based on the
syllabic writing system
[Kikakui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mende_Kikakui_script) created by Mohamed
Turay in 1917. Due to the larger phoneme inventory of Hîsyêô compared to Mende,
only seventeen glyphs were selected to form the base consonants of Hîsyokûî. The
medials (vowels) are extra strokes/flourishes added to the base consonant.
Additionally, the vowel diacritic is present in this script as well to
differentiate between the vowel pairs. Lastly, the script uses a top diacritic
to represent codas similar to the Hîskonû script. The video content will be done
only in the Hîsyokûî script but the website content is presented in all three
scripts.
