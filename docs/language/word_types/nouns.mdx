# Nouns

A type of word that represents an entity (abstract or concrete). A noun can be a
compound of several words using genitive phrases and relative clauses. When a
noun is more than one word, it is called a **noun phrase**. A noun phrases
contains a nucleus or head noun and quantifiers are on the left and modifiers
are chained to the right. The nearer the modifiers are to the nucleus, the more
innate the quality is.

## Roles

Each noun phrase within a sentence is preceded by a particle word called a
**preposition**. A preposition cannot be immediately followed by another
preposition. If a preposition is immediately after a
[connector](./connectors.md), it indicates a new sentence fragment.

### Causer / Voluntary Subject

The <HisyeoWord is='û'/> particle precedes this noun phrase. If this is the
first noun phrase of a sentence, the particle can be elided (skipped).

During causative sentences, a NP with this role represents the *causer*. During
non-causative sentences, a NP with this role will be the **agent** or
**experiencer** of the action or state. Additionally during non-causative
sentences, the marked noun phrase is making the choice to commit the act or
experience the state of the predicate of their own free will. In linguistics
this case is known as the **agentive** case.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the subject of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but by something other
than the marked noun phrase.

### Causee / Involuntary Subject

The <HisyeoWord is='ôlê'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role will represent the *causee*.
During non-causative sentences, a NP with this role will be the agent or
experiencer of the action. Additionally during non-causative sentences, the
marked noun phrase is **not** making the choice to commit the act of their own
free will. Either they are bound/forced to do so or they do not have the
wherewithal to make a conscious choice on the matter and are acting out of some
basic instinst. In linguistics, this case is sometimes referred to as the
**causal-agentive** case.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/> it has the
equivalent semantic interpretation as the voluntary subject particle <HisyeoWord is='û'/>.

### Patient, Theme, Stimulus (Direct Object)

Any free-standing verb will precede this noun phrase. Between the verb and the
noun phrase can exist several verb modifier particles. See [Verbs](./verbs.mdx)
for more details.

The role of this object is for the special thematic argument to transitive
verbs. The argument (the direct object) can be broken down into sub-types: a
*patient*, a *theme*, or a *stimulus*. In English, this represents some of the
senses of the word "to" and "into" (although, many English verbs don't rely on a
preposition particle to introduce their direct object).

:::caution Base Verbs Without This Particle

You can provide a verb prepositionally without also providing a direct object
noun phrase. Simply start another preposition, use a connector to create a
compound sentence, use a comma to end a clause or use a period to end a sentence
(the only thing you can't do is immediately follow a verb with another verb
because it will be perceived as being the direct object of the preceding verb).
Not using this noun phrase slot can have an impact on how base verb sentences
are interpreted. Without providing a direct object, a base verb is interpreted
as being *intransitive* or in an unthematic and generic manner (since no theme
is being provided). That being said, sometimes it's easiest to just think of an
implicit <HisyeoWord is='ni'/> existing in the direct object slot.

:::

A **patient** is an entity that undergoes the action and changes state in some
manner. A **theme** is an entiy that undergoes the action but doesn't change
state. A **stimulus** is an entity that prompts or triggers the emotional or
sensory action that is being described. These kinds of direct objects aren't
separately marked because which kind of object is being specified can be
determined from the verb that is being used.

When this noun phrase is preceded by the negatitive
particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the marked noun phrase is either
excluded from being the argument of the committed act of the predicate or that
the act itself was committed but with a direct object that is something other
than the marked noun phrase.

### Manner or Material

The <HisyeoWord is='bi'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent the manner or material of the
predicate. In English, this is represented by the use of words with the "-ly"
suffix (adverbs) or some senses of the words "by" and "with". In linguistics, this might be seen as a kind of adverbial case but the word "adverbial" is ill-fitting to the grammar of Hîsyêô so the term **methodological** case is being used instead.

:::info Thematic Relations

This preposition and the remaining described here can be used with intransitive
and transitive verb predicates and are only needed in certain circumstances when
extra thematic information is useful to describing the predicate in a new way.
These prepositions are known as **true thematic relations**. Subjects
(<HisyeoWord is='û'/> or <HisyeoWord is='ôlê'/>) are honorary members of the
thematic relation club since they are traditionally referred to as
**morphosyntactic arguments**. They are included in the same class of word as
the true thematic relations to simplify the grammatical system. This system is
what allows the language to have **free constituent ordering**.

:::

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the manner or material of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but in a
manner that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In English, this
represents some of the senses of the word "without".

### Instrument or Means

The <HisyeoWord is='tô'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent some entity that was used to
carry out the action. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
words "with", "using", "by", and "via". In linguistics, this is known as the
**instrumental** case.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the means or instrument of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but by means
or with an object that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the word "without".

### Location or Time

The <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent where or when the action
occurs. In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "in", "at",
and "on". In linguistics, this might be called either a **locative** or
**adessive** case.

The counterpart of this particle is <HisyeoWord is='lon'/> for distance and
duration. Unlike the <HisyeoWord is='lon'/> particle, when you provide an amount
of time to <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/> it means the length of time that it took to
*achieve* the task specified in the rest of the predicate.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the location or time of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but at a
location or time that is somewhere other than the marked noun phrase.

### Direction or Destination (Indirect Object)

The <HisyeoWord is='mût'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent where the action is directed
towards. In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "to",
"into", and "towards". Any time you might need an **indrect object** or
**recipient**, you can use this preposition to describe that constituent. In
linguistics, this is known as the **dative** case.

:::info Reciprocity

When you use this preposition with this noun phrase:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>xokôn dîzel</p>
</HisyeoTabs>

it means that the predicate is a *reciprocal* action which means that it
happened between the subjects instead of the subjects directing that action
towards some other referred entity.

:::

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the recipient of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with recipient
that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Source or Origin

The <HisyeoWord is='sûn'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent where the action originated. In
English, this represents nearly all of the senses of the word "from" (except for
differentiation and causation). In linguistics, this is sometimes referred to as the **ablative** case.

</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the source or origin of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
source or origin that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Beneficiary or Purpose

The <HisyeoWord is='oxon'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent for whose benefit the action occurs or
the reason for the action. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
word "for". In linguistics, this is sometime referred to as the **causal-final**
case.

:::

When <HisyeoWord is='oxon'/> is used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>,
it means that the marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the
beneficiary/purpose of the committed act of the predicate or that the act itself
was committed but with a beneficiary/purpose that is something other than the
marked noun phrase.

 
### Cause

The <HisyeoWord is='nênko'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent what caused the action to
occur or a past reason that led to the action. Not to be confused with the
causer of the action (<HisyeoWord is='û'/>), this NP would represent a broader
sense including what caused the causer. In English, this represents some of the
senses of the word "because". 

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the cause of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a cause
that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In English, this represents
some of the senses of the word "despite".

### Collaborator

The <HisyeoWord is='ofek'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent a fellow actor that is also
engaged in the same action as the subject. However, the NP is not considered a
subject of the sentence. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
word "with". In linguistics, this would be seen as the **comitative** case.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from participating in the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a participant
that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In English, this represents
some of the senses of the word "without".

### Context or Condition

The <HisyeoWord is='hôn'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent an overarching topic, contextual
detail, or a condition for the underlying sentence. In English, this represents
some of the senses of the words "regarding", "given", "as for", and "when".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo yûnyoû sôlû hôn zuwobû ilik.&emsp;<em>"I have a question regarding your earlier answers."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Also, when you would like to utilize an adjective complement to complete the
meaning of a subject complete (<HisyeoWord is='li'/>), you would place the
complement in a <HisyeoWord is='hôn'/> NP.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo li xowosê hôn fos nîmû kôto sî ulyô.&emsp;<em>"I am happy that you said that"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the topic or context of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
topic/context that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In English,
this represents some of the senses of the word "regardless".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>umo Depôlo mokon sî ûnfûnô nomû hôn yôk longi ni.&emsp;<em>"Deborah ate the broccoli regardless its color."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Counter-Agent

The <HisyeoWord is='dên'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that either represent a special kind of
goal/agent for verbs that indicates an opposing agent for verbs that indicate an
action that is *oppositional* (where both sides are engaging in an opposing
action). In English, this represents some of the senses of the word "against".
In linguistis, this is sometimes referred to as the **oppositive** case.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>ni li tûu mêdûson hôn xe oûtô bi xîmu tô woyû dên bono woyû.&emsp;<em>"It is hard work to sail against the wind."</em></p>
  <p>nîmû dên fôlnî yê gôcîdon ko.&emsp;<em>"Are you against freedom of choice?"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the counter-agent of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
counter-agent that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Evidence

The <HisyeoWord is='oldis'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent proof or an information source that the
specified action is known or believed to have occurred, is occurring, or will
occur. In English, this represents some of the senses of the phrases "or so",
"per", and "according to". In linguistis, this is referred to as an
**evidential** case.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>hoî môtô ilik onô û nîo li sî tônkô môtô oldis fos dîzel kôto.&emsp;<em>He was burned in the fire or so they say.</em></p>
  <p>oldis yôcno kon kôson û foko ûnîdû bilît dî ûlgûkîn hoî dûî dus nonkû suhot.&emsp;<em>According to the directions, the glue takes 24 hours to dry.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the proof/source of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with
proof or a source that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Distance or Duration

The <HisyeoWord is='lon'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for noun phrases that represent the time or space that the action
occurs within. This role is related to the location/time role but instead of
describing a moment or point in time/space, this noun phrase represents a period
or length of time/space. In English, this represents some of the
senses of the word "for" or "until". In linguistis, this is known as a
**durative** case.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo kôî dêko lon yoûtî ônî kut cênbô yê mônbili.&emsp;<em>"I can see for kilometres"</em></p>
  <p>nîmû li gô lon ûsên zik.&emsp;<em>"How old are you?"</em></p>
  <p>nîo kôntêsto tô kôto lon yoûtî lono hôn dôcuî.&emsp;<em>They argued for days over a toy.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::info The differences between the distance/duration role and the location/time role

These two roles might at first seem like a trivial distinction given that
quantities already contextually indicate that you are referring to distance or
duration. You can provide a point in time or space to this preposition and it
will be treated like the act had some unknown start time and the end time was
either specified by this noun phrase or is reached when the destination
specified is reached.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo li nô mût gubuyo hoî suhot tukwos yê bitûn xobêk.&emsp;<em>"I was going to the market at 8 o'clock last night."</em></p>
    <p>noyo li nô mût gubuyo lon suhot tukwos hoî bitûn xobêk.&emsp;<em>"I was going to the market until 8 o'clock last night."</em></p>
    <p>nîo bi fîkî li nô mût gîto kônyêc lon xe dêko sî gubuyo cûtî yê îskô yê kûôxi nomû mûncû.&emsp;<em>"He was running to the finish line until he saw the lemonade stand."</em></p>
    <p>nîo bi fîkî li nô mût gîto kônyêc hoî xe dêko sî gubuyo cûtî yê îskô yê kûôxi nomû mûncû.&emsp;<em>"He was running to the finish line at the time he saw the lemonade stand."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

To better understand why it's necessary to distinguish this from location/time,
it might be useful to see the semantic relationship of four of the thematic
roles:

- The **source/origin** role represents a *true* source/origin, sometimes
  contextually distant/ from the action or state.
- The **location/time** role represents the source/origin of just the act or
  state described in the sentence.
- The **destination/recipient** role represents a true destination/recipient,
  sometimes contextually distant/removed from the action or state.
- The **distance/duration** role represents the destination/recipient of just
  the act or state described in the sentence.
  
Of course, we are using the term "recipient" loosely here. The only time an
animate entity would be provided as a noun phrase to a **distance/duration**
preposition would be if that entity related to a specific moment or location
upon the path or duration of the action or state at which point it ceases.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo hoî ôhêl tuluti tô oûtô gîsgûl noyo mût fenûo Kolifôlnyo lon umo Sêlo.&emsp;<em>"I was riding my bike to California until Sarah."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the distance or duration of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
duration or distance that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Intermediate

The <HisyeoWord is='gitno'/> particle precedes this noun phrase. It has a unique
role that, in linguistic terms, it can represent an **inessive** case ("in"); a
combination of **illative** ("into") and **elative** ("out of") to indicate a kind of perfective journey; a kind of **terminative** case that specifies two limits, an upper and lower bounds, on an axis of time or space ("from...to") by using a conjunction. Due to the variety of senses of this case, the name **intermediative** case has been selected instead.

In other words, this role is used for a noun phrase that represents either:
- an entity that the action or state is in the *midst* of,
- an entity that the action or state *was* in the midst of but is now on the
  other side, or
- a conjunction of two noun phrases that represent two boundaries in time or
  space that the action or state occurs *between*.

In English, this represents some senses of the words "in", "through", or "between".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo kôî mokon wutun hôfezî xe gitno bîek wutun.&emsp;<em>"I could eat a hamburger."</em></p>
  <p>nûs kûu oûtô gitno tohilôk pûmi onô oxon xe bucono wokût cî.&emsp;<em>"We should drive through the mountains to save time."</em></p>
  <p>nîmû kôî dêko oûtô onô gitno kûmun obokî zonûbî onô ko.&emsp;<em>"Can you see the car through the south window?"</em></p>
  <p>hôn fos gitno nîmû ûn noyo, û hîskûnco in kôson Hîsyêô li xôn môî&emsp;<em>"Between you and me, Hîsyêô is the best conlang."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the intermediary entity of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with an
intermediary that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Similative

The <HisyeoWord is='misli'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for a NP that represents something that the action or state of
the predicate resembles or is a likeness of. It can also be used to introduce a
[simile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simile). In English, this represents some
of the senses of the words "like" and "as". When used with a subordinate clause,
it can also represent the English phrase "as if". In linguistics, this might be
thought of as a kind of essive case. However, there is some concern that this
case term accurately reflects the functionality in Hîsyêô. So, the term
**similative** case wwas selected instead.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>xoînbo dêko û loi misli siskin loi.&emsp;<em>"He looks like his brother."</em></p>
  <p>sî tûu cô kûnhîun lôc û umo moskûl nokdo misli xe ke zîgîl.&emsp;<em>"The old man stumbled, as if he were about to fall."</em></p>
  <p>golfon onô fos noyo oncêmon ni cihôû xe dêko non foko ôsôlê yê kônyêc wêxôn fêlcîn misli yôk ozûul fin fos noyo oncêmon sî hoî ôhêl.&emsp;<em>The disgust I felt after watching last weekend's horror movie was unlike anything I had felt before.</em></p>
  <p>umo Kiloûdîo bi xûnyu cokyen îskô fin cûbû misli yôk umo Filit fos poxô kon îskô cûbû bi cokyen li niwos dûî yê.&emsp;<em>Claudia hardly ever drinks beer or wine, unlike Phillip, for whom the bar is practically a second home.</em></p>
  <p>xe li mûun, misli yôk nîo&emsp;<em>Being late is unlike him.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is not a likeness of the action or state of the predicate. In
English, the word "unlike" would be an equivalent.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>misli yôk nîmû li yôk ônî cifulo yê xôn êto û noyo.&emsp;<em>"Unlike you, I'm not a great dancer."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Genitive

The <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> particle precedes this noun phrase. There is a key
syntactic difference from the other preposition phrases. For noun phrases with a
genitive role, they appear directly after another noun phrase, they are not
free-standing constituents of the sentence.

This role is used for a noun phrase that is either:

- an attribute
- a possessor, or
- has some other relationship

to the preceding noun. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
word "of".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>nîo bi xoînbo li fonmot yê kon oncêmon umo.&emsp;<em>"He seemed devoid of human feelings."</em></p>
  <p>bêmon in cukto onô kôî dî nîltûgu hoî ozûul wokût tô bêmon yê môî dûî zomo.&emsp;<em>"The contract can be terminated at any time with the agreement of both parties."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::info Genitive Relationships

Using a genitive preposition phrase can create *many different* relationships
between two noun phrases. What these relationships are differs depending on the
context and the words chosen.

Below are a multitude of interesting genitive relationships from around the
world. Not every example is directly translatable into English using the
aforemented "of". Often English makes use of alternative prepositions like
"with", "by", and "for", whereas Hîsyêô only has those kinds of prepositions
attached to a predicate of a sentence (linked to the verb of the sentence).

However, equipped with the simple <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> preposition, context,
and supporting word choices, you can effectively communicate all of these
genitive relations. If your interlocutor still does not understand, you can make
use of clarifying words to achieve the specific meaning you were after.

__Descriptive Genitive__ - Specifies some detail of the preceding phrase.
"described by" or "characterized by" are equivalent English expressions. This is
a catch-all genitive for when the attribution is ambiguous.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>tômôs yê ocûo hûnsik&emsp;<em>"book characterized by a red cover"</em> <small>(lit. book of red skin)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

If you need to explain that the book has a red skin instead of being about red
skin, you can clarify that the genitive relationship is descriptive by using <HisyeoWord is='êtsô'/>:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>tômôs yê êtsô yê ocûo hûnsik&emsp;<em></em> <small>(lit. book of a state of red skin)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Possessive Genitive__ - Specifies the preceding phrase as being owned or
possessed by the attached genitive phrase. "belonging to" or "possessed by" are
English equivalents.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>cîkînîl yê zonwul&emsp;<em>"ear belonging to an animal"</em> <small>(lit. ear of animal)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify that a genitive relationship is possessive by using <HisyeoWord is='yûnyoû'/>: 

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>cîkînîl yê yûnyoû yê zonwul&emsp;<small>(lit. ear of possession of animal)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Familial Genitive__ - Specifies the preceding phrase as having a familial
relationship with the attached genitive phrase. "related to" is an equivalent
English expression. This is considered a subset of Possessive Genitive.

---

__Attributive Genitive__ - Specifies the attached genitive phrase as being an
attribute or innate quality of the preceding phrase. Semantically similar to
regular modifier usage but more emphatic in its attribution.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>îlê yê kôdus&emsp;<em>"sacred building"</em> <small>(lit. building of sacredness)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify a genitive relationship is attributive by using <HisyeoWord is='dî'/>
alone or <HisyeoWord is='yûnyoû'/> and <HisyeoWord is='dî'/>:

<HisyeoTabs>

</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Attributed Genitive__ - Specifies the preceding phrase as being an attribute

  <p>hîyôlî yê dî yê oksûn&emsp;<small>(lit. weakness of a trait of muscles)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You could also try clarifying that even further using <HisyeoWord is='lîmîen'/>:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>hîyôlî yê dî lîmîen yê oksûn&emsp;<small>(lit. weakness of an inner trait of muscles)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify a genitive relationship is content by using <HisyeoWord is='yûnyoû'/> <HisyeoWord is='lîmîen'/>:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>zomo xîmu yê yûnyoû lîmîen yê mîcîn&emsp;<small>(lit. water body of inner possession of fish)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can also clarify this relationship with <HisyeoWord is='môtowo'/>:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>zomo xîmu yê môtowo yê mîcîn&emsp;<small>(lit. water body of content of fish)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Epexegetical Genitive__ - Specifies the attached genitive phrase as being
another *separate* way to explain the preceding phrase. "which is", "that is",

</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Genitive of Production__ - Specifies that the preceding phrase is made by the

  <p>non yê foko ôsôlê&emsp;<small>(lit. movie/show of afraid-ifyer)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

second <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> because otherwise it would mean "an afraid causer"
which is not the intending meaning. The second one, however, does not require
either <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> because of its coupling nature.

explain the preceding phrase. "with reference to" or "with respect to" are
equivalent English expressions. This genitive can often be bettered expressed
using the so thematic role marker.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>eswen wokût yê tûu kon bêûdo noyo&emsp;<em>"more time with respect to my studies"</em> <small>(lit. more time of my learning work)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify this relationship using the connector <HisyeoWord is='en'/> instead
of a genitive phrase:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>eswen wokût kon bêûdo en wokût yê tûu dîzel&emsp;<small>(lit. more studying time than time of other work)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Subjective Genitive__ - Specifies or describes the subject of the preceding
phrase when the preceding phrase is a verb phrase or a noun phrase that contains
an action.  This genitive can always be converted into a sentence where the
genitive noun phrase is the subject of the action. Some constructions could
either be subjective or objective genitive but context can help identify the
appropriate type.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>kôto yê ônî hobîyô onô&emsp;<em>"speech of the announcer"</em></p>
  <p>nô yê hôktun xômûtlô cênbô&emsp;<em>"movement of whales"</em> <small>(lit. movement of big sea mammals)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can also represent this genitive relationship by replacing the whole relation with
a subordinate noun clause:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>fos hôktun xômûtlô cênbô li nô, li kûzoû&emsp;<em>"movement of whales is awesome" (lit. that big sea mammals are moving, is awesome)</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can also clarify this genitive relationship with <HisyeoWord is='kôs'/>:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>nô yê kôs yê hôktun xômûtlô cênbô&emsp;<em>"movement of whales"</em> <small>(lit. movement of result of big sea mammals)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Objective Genitive__ - Specifies or describes the object of the preceding phrase
when the preceding phrase is a transitive verb phrase or a noun phrase that
contains a transitive action. "for", "about", "concerning", "towards", "against"
are English equivalent expressions. This genitive can always be converted into a
sentence where the genitive noun phrase is the object of the action.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>kôto nûs yê mocko&emsp;<em>"our conversation about cats"</em> <small>(lit. our speech of cats)</small></p>
  <p>kelo yê fos sinsî noyo (li gô) dên sinsî dîzel onô&emsp;<em>"a game of my city against the other city"</em> <small>(lit. game of which my city (is) against another city)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify this genitive relationship by replacing the whole relation with
a subordinate noun clause while describing the object (and <HisyeoWord is='kôs'/> can
be used to intepret "about" more appropriately):

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nûs kôto sî sin yê selôhô yê mocko&emsp;<small>(lit. we said things of a topic of cats)</small></p>
    <p>sinsî noyo kelo sî dên sinsî dîzel&emsp;<small>(lit. my city played against another city)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

__Plenary Genitive__ - Specifies or describes the subject and object of the
preceding phrase when the preceding phrase is a verb phrase or a noun phrase
that contains an action. Both subjective and objective genitive forms fit and
the meanings should not contract but instead complement each other.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>kon yûbik yê ôcôto&emsp;<em>"love of God"</em> <small>(lit. loving of God)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can clarify this genitive relationship by replacing the whole relation with
a subordinate noun clause and <HisyeoWord is='xokôn'/> <HisyeoWord is='dîzel'/>:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo ûn ôcôto yûbik xokôn dîzel.&emsp;<small>(lit. I and God love each other)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

The genitive particle isn't used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>
because it's meant to describe nouns through associating other nouns and there's
already an existing way to describe zero nouns (<HisyeoWord is='xûnyu'/>). You can
achieve a similar kind of negative association by using a relative clause.

Converting from the other content types into nouns.

### Verbs

When a verb acts as a noun, it represents an archetypal object that has or will
be involved in the happening of that verb action. Like the suffix "-ed" in
English but also there are many concrete terms that English has to refer to
these entities already. There are four ways that verbs can be expressed as
nouns.

#### Direct/Thematic Objects

When a verb is provided as a thematic object, it represents the archetypal
object/patient/theme of that verb. This can be after verbs (direct objects) or
after prepositions (thematic objects). In this position, they are the nucleus of
a noun phrase.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû ke côûfon mokon xe gitno bîek, ko.&emsp;<em>"Will you make me a sandwich?"</em> <small>(lit. You will cook food that is between bread, yes?)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

<HisyeoWord is='mokon'/> is being used as direct obect noun of the action
"to cook". The thing that we cook (the position of the direct object) is called
a "meal" and the thing that we eat is known as "food". Here, the "meal" is quite
simply "food" in [apposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apposition).

#### Genitive Phrases

A verb can act as a noun when connected to a noun phrase using the <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> particle.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>mût noyo kûu okôt dibo ôfo yê conwêbo.&emsp;<em>"Bring me that box of goods."</em></p>
    <p>kûu wêko yogô onô hoî dibo yê kelo et onô.&emsp;<em>"Put the pieces in the game box."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Abstract Nouns

There is a special coupling particle (<HisyeoWord is='kon'/>) that can convert
verbs directly after it into a noun with abstract connotations that can be
translated into English as "matters of" or "acts of". This form is often used as
the equivalent of simple gerunds where there's no additional thematic context
needed.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>tîmîok kon wêtodû yê towê wîk pipôk&emsp;<em>"bald eagle"</em> <small>(lit. hunting bird of white head feathers)</small></p>
    <p>ôntôn zûngô kon kelo yê kon doîcêl gundolê&emsp;<em>"baseball glove"</em> <small>(lit. playing hand glove of ball catching)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Agentive Nouns

There are two more particles that can convert verbs into nouns and they are both
agentive in nature. This means that the final coupled noun is considered an
agent of some action or state. For the first particle (<HisyeoWord is='ônî'/>),
the entity is a directly engaged in the action or experiencing the state. For
the second particle (<HisyeoWord is='foko'/>), the agent is causing something
else to engage in the action or experience the state.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>foko mefûs wowoê yê kon nô fîkî&emsp;<em>"running shoes"</em><small>(lit. foot safe-causer of fast moving)</small></p>
    <p>ônî nô fîkî&emsp;<em>"runner"</em><small>(lit. fast mover)</small></p>
    <p>fecko foko hûnsik&emsp;<em>"red paint"</em><small>(lit. red-causer liquid)</small></p>
    <p>ônî wêko yê fecko foko longi&emsp;<em>"painter"</em><small>(lit. placer of color-causer liquid)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Modifiers

When a modifier acts as a noun, it means an uncountable quality and/or degree of
being a given state. Like the affix "-ness" in English. One way of making a noun
out of a modifier is to provide it as the nucleus of a verb or a preposition
phrase. Verbs and preposition particles always take the word is immediately
following it as a noun derivation of that word and it is the nucleus of the
preposition phrase (as long as it's a content word, other prepositions can cause
argument to be skipped).

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>wôlik nêlô kôs kûyô&emsp;<em>"Black clouds cause sadness."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Just like with verbs you can create a genitive phrase by preceding the modifier
with the <HisyeoWord is='yê'/> particle. This particle means that the modifier
word that immediately following it is taken as the noun derivation of that word.

This is especially useful for the typical reason that genitive phrases are
useful: it allows you to describe a quality with some modifiers of its own. One
of the most common usages is when adding a degree to a modifier:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>tôxûtsi bûmî yê iwotê êto&emsp;<em>"very tall mountain"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Since Hîsyêô has less than 900 words, using genitive phrases with modifiers
allows you to create more complex phrases that would require several sentences
to formulate otherwise. In fact, modifiers can also be used with <HisyeoWord is='kon'/>, <HisyeoWord is='ônî'/>,
and <HisyeoWord is='foko'/> to make modifier-based abstract and agentive nouns.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>foko lîûlê yê ênkômôn longi et kûyô&emsp;<em>"a sad clown"</em></p>
    <p>kolowu kon xobo foko dês tônkô&emsp;<em>"non-violent martial arts"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Noun Clauses

A noun can be concrete or abstract, it doesn't have to be some physical entity
or even a finite state. It can be a process or really anything that you might
want to refer to and use as a subject or object of a sentence. In Hîsyêô, you
can create these complex nouns by building sentences within a subordinate clause
called a **Noun Clause**. In order to create one of these clauses, you must
start with a particle. There are two special words available that can be used to
introduce a noun clause:

<ol>
  <li><HisyeoWord is='xe'/> - Use this one for infinitives and gerunds</li>
  <li><HisyeoWord is='fos'/> - Use this one for complete inner sentences and indirect questions</li>
</ol>

After this particle, you start your sentence. In the infinitive/gerund form, you
do not provide an agent/experiencer (subject) of the sentence because this is
the nature of how infinitives are used: a noun that refers to the meaning
expressed by the inner sentence but referred holisitically as an object in the
outer sentence.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>li êo golfon ôlê noyo û <strong>xe</strong> côûfon mîcîn.&emsp;<em>"Cooking fish makes me disgusted."</em></p>
  <p><strong>xe</strong> golo, li xôn oxon umo xonluk.&emsp;<em>"Reading is good for kids."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


:::caution Beware the similarity between gerunds and the abstract particle

While these noun clause gerunds are very useful, you must be careful to discern
the distinction of meaning between the gerund usage of a noun clause leading
particle and the abstract particle preceding a content word. The abstract form
should be thought of as "acts of" or "matters of" which should be seen as more
of a loose relationship than using a noun clause as a gerund. "acts/matters of
eating meat" means something different from "eating meat".

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo toûyen xe mokon oksûn.</p>
    <p>noyo toûyen kon mokon oksûn.</p>
</HisyeoTabs>


The first sentence implies that the speaker hates specifically the act of eating
meat whereas the second sentence implies that the speaker hates matters of meat
eating altogether which broadens the hate to anything related to the act or its
part in human life or otherwise. 

:::

The other form of noun phrase (introduced by <HisyeoWord is='fos'/>) includes a
subject or if one is not provided then, like a normal sentence, it should be
intepreted as dropped or subjectless ("there is" or "it is") depending on the
predicate that is provided. This form of noun phrase is useful when you need to
introduce a clause that changes (or removes) the subject from the underlying
sentence. Some verbs primarily are used with some form of noun clause as their
object and this form allows for a complete sentence to be included as that
object.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo fôlun fos nîmû fôlun noyo&emsp;<em>"I want you to want me"</em></p>
  <p>noyo xîwon fos li suhot tîû&emsp;<em>"I wish that it was 5 o'clock"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


:::info English indirect object

The English sentence in the translation above "I want you to want me" is using
an indirect object of "you" and an direct object infinitive phrase of "to want
me". This might seem like the wrong translation since there is a preposition
that Hîsyêô typically uses for indirect objects. This is just an example of some
of the irregular English grammar around the use of the verb "to want". In
Hîsyêô, the best approach is to use a finite noun phrase where the indirect
object of the English sentence is now the subject of the inner noun clause.

:::

### Thematic Noun Clauses

When you use a subordinate clause as the nucleus of a preposition phrase,
it often takes on a special meaning due to the combination of a thematic role
and the non-concrete nature of subordinate clauses. Here's a list of the
different interpretations:

#### Manner/Material: Accusative Relative Clause

Possibly the most unique of the bunch, due to the fact that this thematic
relation is normally used for describing the action directly. When the
manner/material thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it amends the
description of the **direct object** as a relative clause.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>bi fos bi ubênus wuîtsî xe ogolol, noyo lunsol sî gundolê nubuso yê zomo onô bi len sumon en fos noyo kôî tûu.&emsp;<em>"Barely keeping a grip on it, I throw the dog's wet ball as hard as I can."</em></p>
    <p>bi fos unon îskô cûbû ûn bîek sûn, nûs dênêmêk xe yosten gubuyo kon îskô onô hoî sinsî cûtî onô.&emsp;<em>"Smelling of beer and bread, we searched the small town for the local tavern."</em></p>
    <p>bi xe sityo hoî môtô onô, li zowo xe tô hokôlî ogolol sî siskin wohî nîmû.&emsp;<em>"Sitting by the fire was the dog that bit your sister."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::caution Why the shift in meaning

It might seem like this should just describe the manner since that's what this
preposition is for. But, it isn't used for that in this case because the
primary sentence structure is already the place where all simultaneous
predicates exist. That is to say, if you are describing the *action* by further
utilizing another verb (and you are thinking about using a subordinate clause),
you can place this verb as another predicate within the main sentence body
instead of using a preposition particle. This frees up this marker (when
supplied with a subordinate clause) to be used for describing the direct object.
Syntactically, this is the only valid preposition that can take a relative
clause. Given that this marker is the only one that applies the supplied noun
phrase *adverbially*, it follows that any subordinate clause should be
interpreted as being related to the nucleus of the direct object.

:::



#### Instrument/Means: Nominal Subordinate Clause

When the instrument/means thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it does
not have a special interpretation because there are already reasonable
situations where an instrument or means could be described using a subordinate
clause.

#### Location/Time: Iterative Condition Subordinate Clause

When the location/time thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it has a
special interpretation because there's no valid situation where a location or a
time could be a full predicate. Just like the other thematic roles, the usage of
this preposition with a subordinate clause is still meant to be
semantically relevant. Thus, the meaning is taken as an **iterative condition**
which in English can be interepreted as a clause prefaced by "whenever".

#### Direction/Destination: Terminative Condition Subordinate Clause

When the direction/destination thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it
has a special interpretation because there's no valid situation where a
direction or a destination could be a full predicate. Just like the other
thematic roles, the usage of this preposition with a subordinate clause is
still meant to be semantically relevant. Thus, the meaning is taken as a
**terminative condition** which in English can be interepreted as a clause
prefaced by "until".

#### Source/Origin: Inchoative Condition Subordinate Clause

When the source/origin thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it has a
special interpretation because there's no valid situation where a source or an
origin could be a full predicate. Just like the other thematic roles, the usage
of this preposition with a subordinate clause is still meant to be
semantically relevant. Thus, the meaning is taken as a **inchoative condition**
which in English can be interepreted as a clause prefaced by "since".

#### Beneficiary/Purpose: Nominal Subordinate Clause

When the beneficiary/purpose thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it
does not have a special interpretation because there are already reasonable
situations where a beneficiary or purpose could be described using a subordinate
clause.

#### Cause: Nominal Subordinate Clause

When the cause thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it does not have a
special interpretation because there are already reasonable situations where a
cause could be described using a subordinate clause.

#### Collaborator: Nominal Subordinate Clause

When the collaborator thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it does not
have a special interpretation because there are already reasonable situations
where a collaborator could be described using a subordinate clause.

#### Context/Condition: Nominal Subordinate Clause

When the collaborator thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it does not
have a special interpretation because there are already reasonable situations
where context or a condition could be described using a subordinate clause.

#### Counter-Agent: Nominal Subordinate Clause

When the counter-agent thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it does not
have a special interpretation because there are already reasonable situations
where a counter-agent could be described using a subordinate clause.

#### Evidence: Nominal Subordinate Clause

When the evidence thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it does not
have a special interpretation because there are already reasonable situations
where a evidence could be described using a subordinate clause.

#### Distance/Duration: Durative Condition Subordinate Clause

When the distance/duration thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it has a
special interpretation because there's no valid situation where a distance or a
duration could be a full predicate. Just like the other thematic roles, the
usage of this preposition with a subordinate clause is still meant to be
semantically relevant. Thus, the meaning is taken as a **continuative
condition** which in English can be interepreted as a clause prefaced by "while"
or "during".

#### Intermediate: Nominal Subordinate Clause

When the intermediate thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, it does not
have a special interpretation because there are already reasonable situations
where a intermediate could be described using a subordinate clause.

#### Similative: Comparative Condition Subordinate Clause

When the similative thematic role is applied to a *noun clause*, they do
reflect normal subordinate clauses but since this preposition fits the
special similative class, there's a special way to intepret its usage
wth noun clauses. The meaning is taken as a **comparative condition** which in
English can be interepreted as a clause prefaced by "as if".


### Relative Clauses

There are other uses of these same clause particles as relative clause
introducers and you can learn more about those usages [here](modifiers#relative-clauses).
