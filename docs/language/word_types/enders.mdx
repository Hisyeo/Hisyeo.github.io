# Enders

Marking mood, emotion, and intent.

Enders (often called **Sentence Final Particles** in linguistics) are words placed at the very end of a sentence or clause to indicate the speaker's attitude, the sentence's function (question vs. statement), or the emotional intensity.

## Clause Enders

Currently, the only true clause ender is the comma, and it is treated as a slight pause in spoken language.

### The Comma

Unlike some constructed languages (like
[Kokanu](https://en.kokanu.com/reference/special-words/hu.html)) that use a
spoken word for commas to separate nested clauses, Hîsyêô relies on its
verb-converting particle words to reduce the reliance on them. Therefore, the
comma is purely prosodic.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hôn fos nîmû li nô, kûu xokûlû noyo.&emsp;<em>If you go, call me.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Sentence Enders

Sentence enders are the primary way Hîsyêô speakers express register—the tone
and social context of the speech. A sentence without an ender is considered
Declarative/Neutral.

| Word                      | Function     | English Equivalent   | Mood          |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| <HisyeoWord is='lôtfen'/> | Politeness   | Please / Sir / Ma'am | Precative     |
| <HisyeoWord is='ko'/>     | Question     | ? / Right?           | Interrogative |
| <HisyeoWord is='cî'/>     | Proposal     | OK? / How about?     | Propositive   |
| <HisyeoWord is='lôîcôk'/> | Confirmation | Indeed / Actually    | Assertive     |
| <HisyeoWord is='foxo'/>   | Surprise     | Wow! / Whoa!         | Mirative      |
| <HisyeoWord is='ze'/>     | Emotion      | ! / Damn!            | Exclamatory   |

### Politeness

**Mood:** Precative / Softening

The politeness ender ( <HisyeoWord is='lôtfen'/> ) softens a command into a
request or simply adds a layer of respect to a statement. It is used with
friends and superiors alike to show care.

#### Advanced Usage

When combined with specific verb markers, this particle shifts the grammatical
mood of the sentence significantly.

:::note Permissive Mood

**Marker:** Epistemic ( <HisyeoWord is='kôî'/> )&emsp;+&emsp;<HisyeoWord is='lôtfen'/>

**Meaning:** Granting permission or authorization. It changes "can" into "may."

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû kôî gomî bîek lôtfen.&emsp;<em>You may take the bread. (Permission granted).</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

:::note Concessive Mood

**Marker:** Epistemic ( <HisyeoWord is='kôî'/> )&emsp;+&emsp;<HisyeoWord is='lôtfen'/>

**Meaning:** Admitting a point in an argument or acknowledging a possibility
politely. It changes "might" into "granted" or "admittedly."

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ulyô kôî li hokîkî lôtfen.&emsp;<em>That may well be true. (I concede that point).</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

:::note Benedictive Mood

**Marker:** Deontic ( <HisyeoWord is='kûu'/> ) + <HisyeoWord is='lôtfen'/>

**Meaning:** Expressing a blessing, well-wishing, or hope for the future. It
changes "should" into "may."

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû kûu li gô bi xôn lôtfen.&emsp;<em>May you be well. (I wish wellness upon you).</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

### Question

**Mood:** Interrogative

The question ender ( <HisyeoWord is='ko'/> ) is the standard particle for
turning a statement into a Yes/No question. It asks for a truth value.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû li xôn ko?&emsp;<em>Are you well?</em></p>
    <p>nîo ke li nô ko?&emsp;<em>Is she going to go?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Proposal

**Mood:** Propositive / Suggestive

Unlike <HisyeoWord is='ko'/>, which asks for facts, <HisyeoWord is='cî'/> asks for agreement or consent. It turns a
statement into a suggestion or a check-in.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>¿nûs li nô hoî ulyô bi fêlcîn cî?&emsp;<em>We go there first, okay?</em>&emsp;<small>(Suggestion)</small></p>
    <p>¿nîmû li cunyû cî?&emsp;<em>You're cold, right?</em>&emsp;<small>(Checking assumption)</small></p>
    <p>¿noyo ke côûfon cî?&emsp;<em>I'll cook, sound good?</em>&emsp;<small>(Offer)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Advanced Usage

:::note Propositive Mood

**Marker:** Deontic (<HisyeoWord is='kûu'/>)&emsp;+&emsp;<HisyeoWord is='cî'/>

**Meaning:** A direct suggestion or proposal for action.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nûs kûu côûfon cî.&emsp;<em>We should cook, don't you think?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

:::note Hypothetical / Tentative Mood

**Marker:** Epistemic (<HisyeoWord is='kôî'/>)&emsp;+&emsp;<HisyeoWord is='cî'/>

**Meaning:** Staking a belief that a statement is possible or likely. It
expresses a tentative hypothesis or potential event.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo kôî li gô hoî niwos cî.&emsp;<em>He might be home, I suppose.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

:::note Gnomic Mood

**Marker:** Realis ( Unmarked )&emsp;+&emsp;<HisyeoWord is='cî'/>

**Meaning:** While sometimes a simple proposal, this often indicates a general
truth or principle about the universe (aorist/gnomic) that the speaker is
validating.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>bînton lono li nô bi cên cî.&emsp;<em>The sun rises.</em>&emsp;<small>(it is a known truth)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

### Confirmation

**Mood:** Assertive / Emphatic

The confirmation ender ( <HisyeoWord is='lôîcôk'/> ) asserts that the statement is true, often contrary to doubt or as
a validation of someone else's statement. It acts like the English emphatic
auxiliary "do/did."

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo tûu sî yoûtî foût lôîcôk.&emsp;<em>He did make several mistakes.</em>&emsp;<small>(Confirming a fact)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo li xoînbo nîmû lôîcôk.&emsp;<em>I really do look like you.</em>&emsp;<small>(Realization/Assertion)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû kûu li yoûmok lôîcôk.&emsp;<em>Surely, you must be joking.</em>&emsp;<small>(Strong inference)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Surprise

**Mood:** Mirative

The <HisyeoWord is='foxo'/> ender marks information that is new, unexpected, or surprising to the speaker. It
is the vocal equivalent of a wide-eyed facial expression.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû li sî gîk foxo.&emsp;<em>Wow, you made it!</em>&emsp;<small>(I didn't think you would)</small></p>
    <p>nîo dôstoc kelo xokôn foxo.&emsp;<em>He scored!</em>&emsp;<small>(Excitement at the event)</small></p>
    <p>nîo ke li zîgîl foxo.&emsp;<em>Whoa, they are going to fall!</em>&emsp;<small>(Sudden realization)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Emotion

**Mood:** Exclamatory / Aggressive

The <HisyeoWord is='ze'/> ender adds intense emotional weight. It can range
from strong encouragement to anger or frustration. It effectively replaces swear
words by infusing the sentence with raw intensity.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>kûu lîsto ze!&emsp;<em>Stop!</em>&emsp;<small>(Command)</small></p>
    <p>noyo li bîcûon ze.&emsp;<em>I am so tired!</em>&emsp;<small>(Complaint)</small></p>
    <p>nûs kûu li nô ze!&emsp;<em>Let's GO!</em>&emsp;<small>(Hype/Aggression)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
