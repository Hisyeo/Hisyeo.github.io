# Modifiers

A type of word that describes a predicate or a noun phrase. Often called
adjectives or adverbs.

## Prepositions

There are only a few prepositions applicable to the modifier class of words.

### Subject Complement

The <HisyeoWord is="li"/> particle precedes this modifier.

This role is used when the modifier is describing the subject (an adjective
complement), roughly equivalent to "is [adjective]" in English. When used
without a subject, it implies "It is [adjective]" or "There is [quality]".

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ni li xôn.&emsp;<em>"It is good."</em></p>
    <p>li cunyû.&emsp;<em>"It is cold." / "There is coldness."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>



### Positive

The <HisyeoWord is="in"/> particle allows you to specify that any content word
which is being used as a modifier is seen as positive in meaning when applied as
a modifier to the preceding head phrase. This is primarily useful for using
verbs as modifiers since they are prepositions otherwise.

### Negatitive

The <HisyeoWord is="dês"/> particle allows you to specify that any content word
which is being used as a modifier is seen as negated in meaning when applied as
a modifier to the preceding head phrase. While this is useful for using verbs as
modifiers, it also can be useful for all other modifiers and nouns as
modifiers.

### Collapsing Head

The <HisyeoWord is="et"/> particle allows you to specify that any following
modifier (whether it's a true modifier or a noun/verb being used with one of
the modifier particles above or a noun particle) is seen as applying meaning to
the *entire* noun or verb phrase instead of only being applicable to the
immediately preceding head phrase.

This particle is also useful for ending a determiner-led phrase before a nucleus
can be added thus making the determiner phrase headless which means that the
determiner is instead interpreted pronomically.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>🚨 noyo en nîmû bi mênûs lunsol hoî ûsên ôfo.&emsp;<em>I am less projectile-like than you this year.</em></p>
    <p>noyo en nîmû bi mênûs et lunsol hoî ûsên ôfo.&emsp;<em>I threw less than you this year.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::caution Verb Immunity

Verbs cannot be preceded by a collapsing head particle directly. This is because
the collapsing head particle does not change the semantics of that syntactic
position. It simply closes the prior elements as a new nucleus and then the
syntactic context of the following word is as a modifier of that newly collapsed
nucleus. Since verbs cannot act directly as dependent modifiers to a nucleus,
they cannot exist directly after this particle.

If you need to describe the newly formed nucleus with a verb, you must use one
of particles that converts a verb to a noun or modifier derivation.

## From...

Converting from the other content types into modifiers.

### Nouns

When a noun acts as a modifier, it means that the head word is somehow related
to the noun (acting as a modifer) or shares some recognizable quality with the
noun. Like the affix "-like" in English. One way of making a modifier out of a
noun is to provide it as a word immediately following <HisyeoWord is="uyo"/>.
This has the effect of meaning "[noun]-like thing" in English. You can use it
following any head noun or existing modifier chain (within a genitive phrase).

That said, nouns often don't need any added particle, but when the noun is
action-oriented, it can be useful to use the abstract noun particle (<HisyeoWord is="kon"/>) or
the modifier particles above. This helps differentiate the attributed thing from
being attributed directly to the action itself compared to things that are used
*for* an action or are more tangentially related.


### Verbs

A verb cannot act as a modifier, it must be preceded by either one of the
modifier particles above or a [noun particle](nouns#verbs). The verb and particle combined act
as one word of the base modifier type. You can use it following any head noun or
existing modifier chain.


## Relative Clauses

You can modify a preceding verb or noun phrase by using one of the relative
clause particles:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>xe - <em>Use this one when the subject is **shared** from the outer sentence</em></p>
    <p>fos - <em>Use this one when the subject is **changed** from the outer sentence</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When you use the first form, the subject of the inner clause is linked to the
nucleus that the relative clause is attached to.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>umo wohî xe niwos hoî zinkon uklo hôn noyo, wêloi hoî sêdu munî.&emsp;<em>"The woman who lives next door works in a bank."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When you use the second form (<HisyeoWord is="fos"/>), you must provide at least
one constituent that refers to the nucleus noun phrase, this is called the
**resumptive phrase**. The preferred resumptive phrase is the final constituent
of the relative clause which is then dropped and implied to refer to the nucleus.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>umo fos noyo cûdo înbolî mût, dî sî xe monodo.&emsp;<em>"The person that I gave a flower to came to visit."</em></p>
    <p>nîo li umo fos dêko noyo û.&emsp;<em>"They are the person who saw me."</em></p>
    <p>îlê fos noyo niwos, li nokdo êto.&emsp;<em>"The house in which I live is very old."</em></p>
    <p>gûexo onô fos nîo toswîl sî nênko, li mûlû lôîcôk.&emsp;<em>"The war that he painted because of is finally over."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When you want to organize your relative clause in a topical manner, the
demonstratives can act as resumptive pronouns. Use the proximal demonstrative (<HisyeoWord is="ôfo"/>) when
referring to the speaker or objects that the speaker possesses, use the medial
demonstrative (<HisyeoWord is="ulyô"/>) when referring to the person being
addressed or objects possesed by that person, use the distal demonstrative (<HisyeoWord is="onô"/>) when
referring to someone else other than the person being addressed or objects
possessed by that third party.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p><b>ôfo</b> li non fos noyo fôlun xe mônîso <b>ôfo</b> mût nîmû.&emsp;<em>"This is the video that I wanted to show you."</em></p>
    <p>li sî yôûlî êto û umo <b>onô</b> fos nîo kôto sî <b>onô</b>.&emsp;<em>"The person they spoke to was really helpful."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
