# Connectors

Joining thoughts, phrases, and clauses.

Connectors or conjunctions are words used to join two thoughts together. In
Hîsyêô, the function of a connector depends entirely on what follows it.

## The Syntactic Rule

The most important rule to remember with connectors is **look ahead**:

1. **Phrase Connector:** If the connector is followed by a **Content Word** (Noun,
   Verb, Modifier), it joins that word to the current phrase.

2. **Clause Connector:** If the connector is followed by a **Preposition** (like <HisyeoWord is='û'/>, <HisyeoWord is='li'/>, <HisyeoWord is='hoî'/>), it ends the current predicate and begins a new clause.

  **Note on Verbs:** If you place a raw Verb after a connector (e.g., ...  <HisyeoWord is='ûn'/> <HisyeoWord is='mokon'/>),
  it is treated as a **Noun** (food) added to the current list. To
  say "I eat and drink" (two actions), you must start a new predicate with a
  preposition or omit the connector to let the verb stand alone. Irrealis verb
  markers do free you from this restriction.

## The Connectors

| English       | Hîsyêô                   | Function                 |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| And           | <HisyeoWord is='ûn'/>    | Cumulative / Additive    |
| Or            | <HisyeoWord is='yodo'/>  | Alternative / Choice     |
| But / However | <HisyeoWord is='lêkin'/> | Adversative / Contrast   |
| Than / As     | <HisyeoWord is='en'/>    | Comparative              |
| Then / So     | <HisyeoWord is='bînê'/>  | Sequential / Resultative |

## Cumulative (And)

### As a Phrase Connector

Combines two nouns or qualities into a single unit within the sentence.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo sûko kûôxi ûn oksûn.&emsp;<em>I like fruit and meat.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### As a Clause Connector

Indicates that two actions or states occur simultaneously or in the same timeframe.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo mokon ûn û noyo îskô.&emsp;<em>I eat and I drink.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Alternative (or)

### As a Phrase Connector

Presents a choice between items. Only one is selected or valid.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>¿nîmû fôlun kûôxi yodo oksûn ko?&emsp;<em>Do you want fruit or meat?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### As a Clause Connector

Presents a choice between two potential outcomes or actions.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nûs kôî li nô yodo û nûs kôî li bodî hoî niwos.&emsp;<em>We can go or we can stay at home.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Adversative (but/however)

### As a Phrase Connector

Adds an item that contrasts with the previous one, often modifying the expectation.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo fôlun kûôxi lêkin xûnyu bîek.&emsp;<em>I want fruit but no bread.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### As a Clause Connector

Links two independent sentences where the second contradicts or qualifies the
first.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo fôlun mokon lêkin û noyo li bîcûon.&emsp;<em>I want to eat, but I am tired.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Comparative (than/as)

### As a Phrase Connector

Used to establish a standard of comparison against the first item. This is
essential for comparative sentences.

:::warning English-ism Alert

In English, we often say "She is taller than me," where "me" acts as a shortened
version of "than I am." In Hîsyêô, <HisyeoWord is='en'/> connects phrases or
clauses directly. It does not automatically replace the agent or subject. You
should construct the comparison to be syntactically complete or clearly linked
within the constituent.

:::

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo en noyo li iwotê eswen.&emsp;<em>She (compared to) me is taller.</em></p>
    <p>li iwotê eswen û nîo en noyo.&emsp;<em>Is taller she (compared to) me.</em></p>
    <p>noyo bi eswen et fôlun xe mokon, en xe li conzodo.&emsp;<em>I more want to eat than to sleep.</em></p>
    <p>nîo li iwotê sumon en noyo.&emsp;<em>She is as tall as me.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### As a Clause Connector

Comparisons can occur between full clauses when comparing the degree of two
different actions. This is often the clearest way to express complex
comparisons.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo li iwotê eswen en û nîo (li iwotê).&emsp;<em>She is taller than she (is tall).</em></p>
    <p>noyo fôlun mokon bi eswen en û noyo fôlun xe li conzodo.&emsp;<em>I want to eat more than I want to sleep.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Superlatives

To express a superlative ("the most" or "the best"), you compare the subject to
all others using <HisyeoWord is='môî'/>.

<HisyeoTabs>
<p>nîo en môî li iwotê eswen.&emsp;<em>She (compared to all) is the tallest.</em></p>
<p>ôfo en môî li xôn eswen.&emsp;<em>This (compared to all) is the best.</em></p>
<p>noyo en xûnyu li conzodo eswen.&emsp;<em>I (compared to noone) am the most sleepy.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


:::tip Super skip a 'tive

Avoid the need for a comparative connector altogether by using <HisyeoWord is='môî'/> and
<HisyeoWord is='xûnyu'/> as adjectives to mark superior and inferior superlative
degrees directly, similar to how <HisyeoWord is='eswen'/> and <HisyeoWord is='mênûs'/> mark
superior and inferior comparative degrees.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo li iwotê môî.&emsp;<em>She is the tallest.</em></p>
    <p>ôfo li xôn môî.&emsp;<em>This is the best.</em></p>
    <p>noyo li conzodo xûnyu.&emsp;<em>I am the least sleepy.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Sequential (then/so/therefore)

### As a Phrase Connector

Indicates a sequence or hierarchy within a list.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo dêko nîmû bînê nîo.&emsp;<em>I see you, then [I see] her. (You first, her second).</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### As a Clause Connector

Indicates that the second clause happens after the first, or is a result of the first.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo ke mokon bînê û noyo ke conzodo.&emsp;<em>I will eat, then I will sleep.</em></p>
    <p>li bôkbûn bînê û nûs li sî bodî hoî niwos.&emsp;<em>It was storming, so we stayed home.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
