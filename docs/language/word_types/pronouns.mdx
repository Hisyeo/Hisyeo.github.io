# Pronouns

Pronouns are a closed class of words used as references or substitutions for
noun phrases. In Hîsyêô, pronouns do not change form based on case
(subject/object), their role is determined entirely by the preposition that
precedes them.


## Personal Pronouns

Pronouns in Hîsyêô do not distinguish gender. They distinguish between
**animate** (people/animals) and **inanimate** (objects/concepts). Plurality is
usually contextual or marked by the determiners <HisyeoWord is='êto'/>, <HisyeoWord is='yoûtî'/>, or <HisyeoWord is='môî'/> if
specificity is needed.

:::info Plurality & Clusivity

There is only one plural pronoun and that's for 1st person plural ("we", "our",
and "us" in English). The word <HisyeoWord is='nûs'/> is used for _exclusive_
1st-person plural but by prepending <HisyeoWord is='môî'/> you can achieve an
inclusive 1st-person plural. All other pronouns are technically number-neutral.
Context usually implies number. However, to be explicit, you can modify the
pronoun with a determiner:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>môî nîmû&emsp;<em>You all</em><small>&emsp;(lit: all of you)</small></p>
    <p>dûî nîo&emsp;<em>The two of them</em>&emsp;<small>(lit: two of you)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Reflexive Pronouns

When the object of a sentence is the same entity as the subject (agent), you
must use the reflexive pronoun to avoid ambiguity.

| Hîsyêô | English | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| <HisyeoWord is='cizî'/>   | -self   | Himself, herself, itself, themselves, myself. |


<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîo dêko nîo.&emsp;<em>He sees him.&emsp;(He sees a different person).</em></p>
    <p>nîo dêko cizî.&emsp;<em>He sees himself.&emsp;(Reflection or introspection).</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

You can always add an additional pronoun as modifier if you want to clarify which self is being referred to.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo kôto fos nîo bi towê ênkômôn kûu wêtû cizî nîo hoî bitûn fêlcîn.&emsp;<em>I told him to shave last night. (I told him to shave <strong>himself</strong> last night) </em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Most of the time, you can safely assume that the reflexive pronoun is referring to the subject of the currently scoped clause.

## Demonstratives (Deixis)

Demonstratives are words used to point at specific things in physical space or within the conversation. Hîsyêô uses a three-way distinction based on distance from the speaker and listener.

### Proximal (Near Speaker)

<strong>Word:</strong> <HisyeoWord is='ôfo'/> <br/>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> This / These <br/>
<strong>Usage:</strong> Refers to something physically close to the speaker, or a topic the speaker just introduced.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo cûdo ôfo.&emsp;<em>I give this (thing in my hand).</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Medial (Near Listener)

<strong>Word:</strong> <HisyeoWord is='ulyô'/> <br/>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> That / Those (by you) <br/>
<strong>Usage:</strong> Refers to something close to the listener, or something the listener just mentioned.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>kûu gomî ulyô.&emsp;<em>Take that (thing near you).</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Distal (Near Neither / Specific)

<strong>Word:</strong> <HisyeoWord is='onô'/> <br/>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> That / The / Yonder <br/>
<strong>Usage:</strong> Refers to something far away from both parties, or a specific, previously established topic. <br/><br/>

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>yonlûs; noyo betîdo fos noyo fôlun onô.&emsp;<em>No, I meant I want that (one over there)</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::tip Definite Article?

In translations it may seem that <HisyeoWord is='onô'/> is the most common
demonstrative. It is often used as a replacement for the <strong>definite
article</strong> ("the").

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>zowo onô</p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Since the entity is distant, this pronoun may only be providing definiteness,
i.e., you are practically saying "A specific dog that isn't nearby." In regular spoken
conversation, Hîsyêô speakers find this added specificity is not necessary
nearly as often you might think. Try to rephrase the sentence in an indefinite
manner and see if the overall intent of the sentence is lost. Very rarely does
the ambiguity not resolve itself through context.

## Possessive Pronouns

In Hîsyêô, pronouns function as possessive adjectives when they are placed
immediately after a noun. There is no change in the pronoun's form; the
syntactic position dictates the relationship.

| Construction   | Literal Meaning   | English Equivalent | Example                |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Noun + Pronoun | Noun [of] Pronoun | Possessive + Noun  | <HisyeoWord is='sûtûô'/> <HisyeoWord is='noyo'/> (my friend) |

Examples:

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>tômôs noyo&emsp;<em>my book&emsp;(lit: book me)</em></p>
    <p>niwos nîo&emsp;<em>her house&emsp;(lit: house she)</em></p>
    <p>kûôxi nûs&emsp;<em>our fruit&emsp;(lit: fruit we)</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Indefinite & Interrogative Pronouns

These pronouns refer to unspecified people or things, or are used to ask questions about them.

| Hîsyêô | Type                   | English              | Example                                             |
|--------|------------------------| ---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| umo    | Indefinite (Animate)   | Someone, One, Person | umo kôto... (Someone said...)                       |
| uyo    | Indefinite (Inanimate) | Something, Thing     | noyo buswen uyo. (I need something.)                |
| zik    | Interrogative          | Which? / What?       | zik li yonlûs? (What is wrong?) |                   |
| dîzel  | Alterity               | Other, Another, Else | nîo li xôn en dîzel. (It is better than the other.) |


## Reciprocity

To express "each other" or mutual action, Hîsyêô uses the phrase xokôn dîzel (literally: each other).

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nûs lîûbît xokôn dîzel.&emsp;<em>We love each other.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Impersonal Pronouns

You can construct an impersonal pronoun by preceding a noun or adjective with <HisyeoWord is='ônî'/>.
This creates a phrase that refers to an entity defined by that quality, similar
to the English construction "the [adjective] one" or "the [noun] one".

When used with a noun, it adopts the modifier-meaning of that noun.

| Construction   | Meaning     | Example    | Translation       |
|----------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| <HisyeoWord is='ônî'/> + Noun/Adj | The [X] one | <HisyeoWord is='ônî'/> <HisyeoWord is='ûnfûnô'/> | The vegetable one |


:::note Usage
This structure effectively acts as a placeholder for a noun that has been omitted but is understood from context or defined by its descriptor.
