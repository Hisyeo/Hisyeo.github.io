# Interjections

A type of word that is a complete expression of a spontaneous phenomenon.

## Primary Interjections

There is currently only one word in Hîsyêô that is actually a word of the class
interjection. There is another word that is included here that will likely be
added at some point but is mostly just a simple interjection for expressing
disgust or discomfort.


<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>bîolî&emsp;<em>"hello!", "welcome!", "greetings!", "bye!", "tata!"</em></p>
    <p>oîyo&emsp;<em>"ouch!", "ugh!", "yuck!"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Secondary Interjections

These are words from other classes that have additional usage as an interection.
These words must be used as a complete sentence in order to effectively be
comprehended as an interjection instead of their standard meaning.


- <HisyeoWord is='foxo'/> "wow!" "oh my!"
- <HisyeoWord is='zik'/> "what?"
- <HisyeoWord is='ko'/> "yes"
- <HisyeoWord is='yôk'/> "no"
- <HisyeoWord is='cî'/> "okay"
- <HisyeoWord is='konxo'/> "thanks"
- <HisyeoWord is='kûzoû'/> "cool"
- <HisyeoWord is='ze'/> "damn!" "shit!"

## Tertiary Interjections

These are phrases that are used for very common expressions.

    <p>kûu yûnlôn (noyo)&emsp;<em>"sorry", "excuse me"</em></p>
