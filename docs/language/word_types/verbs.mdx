# Verbs

A type of word that represents an action. Each sentence will always have a verb
phrase. Verbs are considered a "semi-preposition" because when not proceded by
certain particles, they act just like a preposition introducing a noun phrase
(the direct object of the verb). If you supply the verb before the subject,
nothing changes about the verb phrase (although the subject now must be
introduced with either <HisyeoWord is='û'/> or <HisyeoWord is='ôlê'/>).

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo mokon kûôxi.&emsp;<em>"I ate a fruit."</em></p>
    <p>mokon kûôxi û noyo.&emsp;<em>"A fruit was eaten by me."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Passivity

Hîsyêô doesn't actually have any form of passivity like in the second English
sentence above. Verbs always introduce their object arguments. To simulate
passivity you can:
- place the verb phrase before the subject phrase,
- use a relative clause on an object in a subject complement phrase, or
- use the causative verb particle on a subject complement phrase.

The order of topicality is determined by the order that constituents are
introduced into the sentence.

## Intransitivity

Hîsyêô verbs are fundamentally  *transitive*. When a verb appears without an
explicit direct object, the meaning depends on the syntactic context: the **Main
Clause** or a **Dependent Clause**.

#### Main Clause: Generic Object

If a verb stands alone in a main clause without an object, it implies a generic,
indefinite, or contextual object. It effectively turns the transitive verb into
an activity.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo mokon.&emsp;<em>I eat (food). / I am eating.</em></p>
    <p>nîo kôto.&emsp;<em>He speaks (words). / He is talking.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Dependent Clause: The Gap Strategy

In relative clauses (introduced by <HisyeoWord is='xe'/> or <HisyeoWord is='fos'/>),
the "missing" object inside the clause is understood to be the
nucleus that the clause is modifying. This is the primary way to form relative
clauses where the head noun is the patient/theme.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>kûôxi fos noyo mokon&emsp;<em>The fruit that I eat.</em>&emsp;<small>(Here, mokon has no object because kûôxi is the object)</small></p>
    <p>tômôs fos nîo golo&emsp;<em>The book that she reads.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Open vs. Closed Verbs

While Hîsyêô verbs belong to a single class (transitive), they can be described as **Open** or **Closed** based on their usage in a specific sentence.

#### Closed Verbs

A verb is **Closed** when its direct object slot is filled by an explicit noun phrase. The action has a defined target.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo mokon kûôxi.&emsp;<small>(Closed)</small>&emsp;<em>I eat fruit.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Open Verbs

A verb is **Open** when it does not have a direct object indicated. This "open slot" must be interpreted based on context:

1. **In a Relative Clause:** The open slot refers to the head noun (the antecedent).

2. **In a Subordinate Clause:** It may refer to an unmentioned pronoun or a contextual object. This is one strategy for overcoming the lack of passivity.

    <HisyeoTabs>
        <p>kûôxi ôfo li fos noyo mokon&emsp;<small>(Open)</small>&emsp;<em>This fruit is that which I am eating</em></p>
        <p>kûôxi ôfo li fos mokon&emsp;<small>(Open)</small>&emsp;<em>This fruit is being eaten</em></p>
    </HisyeoTabs>

3. **In a Main Clause:** It indicates that the object is generic, unimportant, or that the verb should be interpreted intransitively (the action itself is the point).

    <HisyeoTabs>
        <p>noyo mokon&emsp;<small>(Open)</small>&emsp;<em>I am eating (food).</em></p>
    </HisyeoTabs>

:::warning Connectors & Prepositions

Watch out for connectors, prepositions, and enders that can immediately follow a verb, it
can look like the verb is closed but in reality, these words are explicitly
indicating that the verb is open (since these words cannot act as objects).

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>oksûn fos nîmû mokon, li mîstu.&emsp;<em>The meat that you are eating is rotten.</em></p>
    <p>noyo lunsol lêkin û nîmû ogolol yôk foxo.&emsp;<em>I threw but you didn't catch!</em></p>
    <p>nio kôto mût noyo bi cosnî.&emsp;<em>He spoke to me privately.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

## Prepositions

### Realis

The most basic form of verbal preposition is the realis form. There is no
prepositional particle when this form is used. When there is no particle
attached to the verb, it means that it is a true (or believed to be true)
statement of an action or state that is occurring or is being experienced *in
reality*. These predicates can be in the past, present or future tense but they
are usually considered to be imperfective and not perfect (since there is a
particle that can specify that the action is perfect).

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hoî wokût zik û nûs mokon hoî bitûn cokyen ôfo.&emsp;<em>What time are we eating this evening?</em></p>
    <p>fonolon lunsol îbûwê mût noyo.&emsp;<em>The monkey is throwing rocks at me.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Irrealis

There are a few different irrealis verb markers that allow for a variety of
different moods indicating that the predicate has not occurred (or isn't known
to have). They precede the verb and are considered prepositions.

#### Epistemic (*what could be*)

This irrealis verb marker (<HisyeoWord is='kôî'/>) indicates that the predicate
*can*, *could*, *may*, or *might* happen. This marker tells you that the speaker/writer either
believes or has knowledge that the predicate may occur but isn't confident that
this future reality is assured or that the possibility of it occurring doesn't
necessitate that it will be. It can also be used in past tense to mean that the
possibility of it occurring in the past was likely or that there is knowledge
that the subject was definitely capable of completing the action. When used to
frame the predicate of a question, it has the effect of asking for permission.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hoî ilik fos noyo li dês dêko, û noyo kôî dêko bi xôn êto.&emsp;<em>Before I was blind, I could see very well.</em></p>
    <p>noyo gonîso fos nîo kôî tûu ni hôn fos nîo fôlun bi hokîkî.&emsp;<em>I think he could do it if he really wanted to.</em></p>
    <p>noyo xîwon xe kôî li xîkô ze.&emsp;<em>I wish I could fly!</em></p>
    <p>noyo kôî yôn ôntôn tetêk mulô bi îlxîzuk ko.&emsp;<em>Could I borrow your coat?</em></p>
    <p>noyo kôî sityo hoî ulyô ko.&emsp;<em>May I sit there?</em></p>
    <p>mocko yê umo Xilôdingu kôî li gô yodo kôî li yôk gô hoî dibo dîncî.&emsp;<em>Schrôdinger's cat may or may not be in the box</em></p>
    <p>nîmû kôî kôto sî bi sêlôhô yê bôkbûn&emsp;<em>You might have warned me about the thunderstorm.</em></p>
    <p>noyo kôî li nô mût kôndodû onô lêkin noyo gôcîdon sî yôk bi ôhêl.&emsp;<em>I might go to the party, but I haven't decided yet.</em></p>
    <p>noyo kôî li gô hoî sityo kûldû lêkin noyo bi môcîbo fôlun fos wêîlun mût noyo misli umo wohî.&emsp;<em>I might be in a wheelchair, but I still want to be treated as a lady.</em></p>
    <p>noyo kôî gomî bîek botuk sûît fêlcîn.&emsp;<em>Might I take the last biscuit?</em></p>
    <p>nûs kôî buswen uyo xe li gîôn eswen yoûtî cî.&emsp;<em>Yeah, I think we might need something a bit sturdier.</em></p>
    <p>nîmû kôî tenkîn ulyô ko.&emsp;<em>Can you hear that?</em></p>
    <p>nîo kôî kôto tô hîskûnco Ingulic, Vulonsê, ûn Dôic.&emsp;<em>She can speak English, French, and German.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Conditional (*what would be*)

The conditional verb marker (<HisyeoWord is='bît'/>) indicates that the
predicate occurring is dependent on some other circumstance that is either
explicitly described or implied.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hôn fos noyo bît li bîlûs hoî xe kôntêsto til yokûntîk, û noyo bît cûdo fun dûî munî mût kûngîyo yôûlî.&emsp;<em>If I won the lottery, I would give half the money to charity.</em></p>
    <p>noyo bît lîûbît xe li nô monodo.&emsp;<em>I would love to come and visit.</em></p>
    <p>kûu dêko bîek sûît yê sobôlê xôn êto ze. noyo bît mokon môî ulyô bi mûlû ze.&emsp;<em>Look at that yummy cake! I would eat that all up!</em></p>
    <p>noyo mût nîmû bît sôlû xe sityo bi koli.&emsp;<em>I would ask you all to sit down.</em></p>
    <p>noyo mût gonîso fos nîo li sî cok bi ilik.&emsp;<em>I would imagine that they have already left.</em></p>
    <p>hôn fos nîo li kôxentê yê mefûs û nîo bît bunyentoc sî xe besol zinkon onô.&emsp;<em>He's very security-conscious, so he would have remembered to lock the door.</em></p>
    <p>nîo bît li gô hoî sinsî Lundun bi îbûdû cokyen.&emsp;<em>They would be arriving in London round about now.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::info The different conditional classifications of English

In English, conditionals are broken down into four types. These different types
are created with different tenses and auxiliaries in English and a similar
differentiation of syntax occurs in what markers you use in Hîsyêô. Regardless
of what marker is on the *consequent* clause, the *antecedent* clause always
uses a conditional verb marker (<HisyeoWord is='bît'/>).

#### Implicative (Zero Conditional)
These conditionals are sentences that express a factual implication instead of a
hypothetical or potential future circumstance. This type of conditional does not
use the conditional verb marker in the *consequent* clause and utilizes one of
the thematic role markers to mark the *antecedent* clause. As stated above, the
conditional verb marker is present in the antecedent verb phrase.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hôn fos gongoxî onô bît ôîtun, li môtô hoî boxô yê lîmîen îlê onô.&emsp;<em>If the alarm goes off, there's a fire somewhere in the building.</em></p>
    <p>hoî fos bît li xômûtlô bôkbûn, û noô onô li cên.&emsp;<em>When the sea is stormy, the waves are high.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

#### Predictive (First Conditional)
These conditionals are sentences that regard the consequences of a probable
**future** event. Like the Zero Conditional, they also do not use the
conditional verb marker in the *consequent* clause and utilizes one of the
thematic role markers to mark the *antecedent* clause. The difference from an
First Conditional is the use of future tense in the consequent clause. Instead
of the future tense marker, you can also use the deontic/imperative marker due
to the added future meaning that is present there as well. When using the future
tense marker on the *consuquent* clause, you can also use the perfective marker
because it's still in the future just the event has ended or the state has been
surpassed.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hôn fos nîo bît sôlû mût noyo, û noyo ke fohoso bêsnêhot nîo bi dîyondê êto.&emsp;<em>If he asks me, I will consider his proposal carefully.</em></p>
    <p>hôn fos nîmû bît li êo foût, umo ke fisun êo ôlê nîmû.&emsp;<em>If you make a mistake, someone will let you know.</em></p>
    <p>hôn fos bît li hûzon cihoû lono mutyu ôfo, kûu li nô mût boxô noyo.&emsp;<em>If it rains this afternoon, come round to my place!</em></p>
    <p>hôn fos nîmû bît li cok hoî îbûdû, û nîmû ke doîcêl oûtô kîskô nîmû lôîcôk.&emsp;<em>If you leave now, you will still catch your train.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

#### Hypothetical (Second Conditional)

These conditionals are sentences used to describe hypothetical, and typically
counterfactual, situations in the **present** or **future** tense. These
sentences do use the conditional verb marker (<HisyeoWord is='bît'/>) on the
*consequent* clause. To encode a future tense on the *consequent* clause, you
can either just drop to the First Conditional or use an adverb phrase with <HisyeoWord is='mîle'/>. Unlike
in English, there's no need to encode the past tense (subjunctive) on the antecedent clause.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hôn fos noyo bît sûko kôndodû, û noyo bît li gô hoî eswen nîo.&emsp;<em>If I liked parties, I would attend more of them.</em></p>
    <p>hôn fos bît li hûzon hoî lono uklo, û umo bît li cifulo hoî tîton onô.&emsp;<em>If it rained tomorrow, people would dance in the street.</em></p>
    <p>hôn fos nîmû bît li cok bi îbûdû, û nîmû bît doîcêl oûtô kîskô nîmû lôîcôk.&emsp;<em>If you left now, you would still catch your train.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

#### Past Hypothetical (Third Conditional)

These conditionals are sentences used to describe hypothetical, and typically
counterfactual, situations in the **past** tense. Like the Second Conditional,
the *consequent* clause is using the conditional verb marker (<HisyeoWord is='bît'/>) but
in addition to that, it is also using either the perfective marker or another
thematic constituent is indicating that this clause is in the past tense.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hôn fos nîmû bît xokûlû sî noyo, û noyo bît li sî nô.&emsp;<em>If you had called me, I would have come.</em></p>
    <p>nîo bît li sî bîlûs hôn fos noyo bît li sî yôûlî mût nîo ko.&emsp;<em>Would he have succeeded if I had helped him?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

---

#### Mixed Conditional

These conditionals are a mixture of the second and third classifications. Either
the antecedent or the consequent clause, but not both, has a past time
reference. When the antecedent clause refers to the past, but the consequent
clause to the present, the condition clause is in the like that of the Third
conditional, while the main clause is like that of the Second conditional. When
the consequent clause refers to the past, but the antecedent clause is not
expressed as being limited to the past, the antecedent clause is expressed as in
the Second Conditional, while the main clause is like the Third Conditional.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hôn fos nîmû bît tûu sî wêloi bi dûndon, nûs bît fuî yôk îxôlô ôfo bi îbûdû.&emsp;<em>If you had done your job properly, we wouldn't be in this mess now.</em></p>
    <p>hôn fos noyo bît li sî êo hûnsûon ôlê umo Keli, noyo bît niwos yôk hoî kûôcyo Elvu bi îbûdû.&emsp;<em>If I hadn't married Kelly, I wouldn't be living in Scotland now.</em></p>
    <p>hôn fos nûs bît li umo gûexo bi ôhêl, nûs bît tûu sî yôk ni misli ulyô.&emsp;<em>If we were soldiers, we wouldn't have done it like that.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

#### Deontic (*what should be*)

To indicate that something should be or ought to be, you would use the deontic
verb marker (<HisyeoWord is='kûu'/>). It indicates that the true state of things
(realis) doesn't match what the speaker expects, believes or desires. A sentence
with the deontic verb marker generally indicates what action should be taken to
rectify the state of things.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo kûu li yôûlî mût nîmû.&emsp;<em>I ought to help you.</em></p>
    <p>nûs kûu li nô ze.&emsp;<em>Let's go!</em></p>
    <p>kûu gomî oksûn ulyô.&emsp;<em>Don't take that meat.</em></p>
    <p>û lîûbît noyo kûu li gô ofek nîmû lôtfen.&emsp;<em>May my love be with you.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


### Future

There is a form of verbal preposition that is on a slightly different dimension
from the realis/irrealis verb markers above. Instead of delineating the mood of
the sentence, this marker indicates that the predicate will occur in the future.
This marker (<HisyeoWord is='ke'/>) indicates what linguists call the **future
tense**.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>umo Zon ke li cok hoî bitûn ôfo.&emsp;<em>John is going to leave tonight.</em></p>
    <p>noyo ke golo tômôs onô.&emsp;<em>I will/shall read the book</em></p>
    <p>nûs kûu fohoso ulyô, nûs ke tûu ko. &emsp;<em>Let us examine that, shall we?</em></p>
    <p>kut yê umo kôlmûdul ke monodo nîmû hoî lono uklo.&emsp;<em>One of our salesmen will visit you tomorrow.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## From...

Converting from the other content types into verbs isn't possible.

### Nouns

A noun cannot act as a verb, it must be provided with the subject complement
marker (<HisyeoWord is='li'/>). This is called a **noun complement**. The subject is being described as
being some noun. This has the effect of meaning "is a [noun]" in English.

:::info Usage with Copula

The base copula word <HisyeoWord is='gô'/> is technically a noun concept
(existence/presence). Therefore, it requires <HisyeoWord is='li'/> to function
as a predicate.

:::

### Modifiers

A modifier cannot act as a verb, it must be provided with the subject complement
marker (<HisyeoWord is='li'/>). This is called an **adjective complement**. The
subject is being described as being some adjective (in some state). This has the
effect of meaning "is [adjective]" in English.

:::warning Not a Verb

Because <HisyeoWord is='li'/> is a preposition and not a verb, it cannot be converted into a noun or modifier itself.

:::

## Verb Modifiers

There are three **verb modifiers** that can be mixed-and-matched in a verb
phrase. They always follow the verb itself (not the verb marker) and they
precede the direct object. The verb marker and the set of verb modifiers circumfix the
verb.

### Negatitive

The negatitive verb modifier (<HisyeoWord is='yôk'/>) turns the verb phrase
into the negated version of itself. In English, this is the "not" adverb.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>hôn xe yôk zûyi ozûul yonlûs, noyo li sî nô bi fôhon.&emsp;<em>Not knowing any better, I went ahead.</em></p>
    <p>nîmû buswen yôk xe xontûn cizî.&emsp;<em>You don’t need to trouble yourself.</em></p>
    <p>môtîfô yôcno li yôk xe funsût.&emsp;<em>The objective is not to lose.</em></p>
    <p>kûu tûu yôk ulyô.&emsp;<em>Don't do that.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Causative

The causative verb modifier (<HisyeoWord is='êo'/>) turns the verb phrase into
the causative version of itself. In English, this is often accomplished using
the "to have" or "to make" helper verb but sometimes there is a completely
separate verb for the causative version of an action.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo ôlê niwos zonwul li êo môtô mût xûnyu.&emsp;<em>I had the barn burned down.</em></p>
    <p>nîmû ôlê nîo boîfôn êo nonto.&emsp;<em>You're making them cry.</em></p>
    <p>umo Zon ke wêko êo sî fecko longi hoî niwos nîo.&emsp;<em>John will have his house painted.</em></p>
    <p>ônî bêûdo fohoso êo sî dênêmêk kon cukto nîo.&emsp;<em>The students get their essays checked.</em></p>
    <p>ônî cûdo yê cîgîlsu ôlê ônî dîyondê ke xokûlû êo ônî cîgîlsu.&emsp;<em>The doctor will have the nurse call the patients.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Perfective

The perfective verb modifier (<HisyeoWord is='sî'/>) turns the verb phrase into
the perfective version of itself. This describes the action as being a complete
whole in contrast to the *imperfective* aspect (the default) of verbs which is
describes the event from a moment adjacent or within the whole action's
duration, a perspective from a single point along the entire occurrence. There
is no equivalent helper verb in English, sometimes the verb used to describe a
whole action is completely different from the verb used to describe the action
in the imperfective aspect.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo xûsten oûtô.&emsp;<em>I wash the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo bi ôhêl xûstên oûtô.&emsp;<em>I was washing the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo xûstên sî oûtô.&emsp;<em>I washed the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo bi ôhêl xûstên sî oûtô.&emsp;<em>I had washed the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo ke xûstên oûtô.&emsp;<em>I shall wash the car.</em></p>
    <p>noyo ke xûstên sî oûtô.&emsp;<em>I will have washed the car.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
