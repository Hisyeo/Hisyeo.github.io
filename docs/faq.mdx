# FAQ

Hîsyêô is a unique project that blends linguistics, art, and philosophy. Here
are answers to the most common questions about its design and culture.

## Linguistic Design

### Why does Hîsyêô have a large vowel inventory?

Most international auxiliary languages (IALs) stick to the standard 5-vowel
system /a e i o u/ to be "easy." Hîsyêô rejects this for two reasons:

1. **Broad Support:** We try to include as much linguistic variety as there is
   broad support for in world languages. Instead of focusing on the intersection
   of all vowel inventories (the lowest common denominator), we looked at the
   *commonality* of vowels. If a vowel passed a certain threshold of usage
   across global language families, we included it as a distinct phoneme to
   better represent the richness of human speech.
2. **Aesthetic:** The specific vowels chosen (including open **o** vs close
   **ô**) create a specific "sound signature" that feels natural and flowing,
   avoiding the robotic "esperanto" sound.

### Why are there fewer than 900 words?

Hîsyêô is an **isolating** and **oligolistic** language.

- **Isolating:** Words don't change form (no conjugations).
- **Oligolistic:** We use a small set of root words ("Lego bricks") to build
  complex concepts. Instead of memorizing a word for "School," you learn
  <HisyeoWord is='îlê'/>, <HisyeoWord is='kon'/>, and <HisyeoWord is='bêûdo'/>
  to make a compound (Learning-matters building). This makes the language
  incredibly fast to learn but infinitely flexible.
- **Cultural Cohesion:** Having a small vocabulary means that complex concepts
  are constructed using *shared* cultural metaphors. This helps prevent
  dialectical cliques caused by disparate first languages among the community
  members. Everyone is using the same building blocks rather than inventing
  divergent local slang for every new concept.

### Why the non-Latin scripts?

While Hîsyêô is fully writable in the Latin alphabet (for accessibility), it
also features a native [Abugida](./language/orthography#hîskonû) and
[Syllabary](./language/orthography#hîsyokûî).

- **Fresh Eyes:** A non-Latin script forces learners to approach the phonemes with fresh eyes. It prevents you from assuming a letter sounds like it does in your native language (e.g., reading "i" as "eye"). It helps you learn the actual sound of Hîsyêô.
- **Identity:** A unique script reminds the learner that they are entering a new cultural space, not just "translating English."
- **Art:** The scripts are designed to be beautiful and calligraphic, treating writing as an act of Kulîôbî (Creativity).

## Politics & Culture

### Why the anti-capitalist angle?

The project isn't anti-capitalist; it is **anti-authoritarian**. By inscribing
this worldview into the core of the culture, we establish it as the code of
conduct for participation in our shared space.

While this may seem utopian, Hîsyêô is designed for *this* world to create an
ethos that can hopefully unite people around a set of *values* instead of
squabbling over implementation details. We've selected **Participatory
Economics** ([ParEcon](https://participatoryeconomy.org)) because it seems to
represent a Hegelian synthesis of capitalism (thesis) and socialism
(anti-thesis).

:::warning A Note on Violence and the State

While Hîsyêô is anti-authoritarian, we explicitly **do not condone violence**
against nation-states or individuals in any form. The path to a better future
must be walked *hand-in-hand*, building confidence in the new path through the
slow, deliberate work of weaving community.

Violence is a tool of the [First Law](./religion/first-law) (coercion); our tool
is the **Weave** (connection). We build the new world in the shell of the old,
not by burning the shell, but by outgrowing it.

:::

### Why ParEcon?

Because we want a system that keeps the freedom of the market while fixing its
bugs. Many people assume that to fix inequality, you have to sacrifice
individual choice and let a central government decide everything. The culture of
Hîsyêô rejects that choice. Instead, we view our economic model as a
*synthesis*: taking the best psychological incentives of the market and combining
them with the fairness of social planning.

In the old world, wealth was often determined by luck, inheritance, or owning
property. In Hîsyêô, we have patched this bug to create a **true meritocracy**.
- **How it works:** We still have income and purchasing power. However, you are
  paid strictly for *effort* and *sacrifice*.
- **The Market Logic:** If you work longer hours, or do the dangerous/boring
  jobs that no one else wants, you earn more credits. If you want a standard
  life, you do standard work. It is the ultimate "pull yourself up by your
  bootstraps" economy; but this time, the math actually works.

---

Capitalism is a guessing game where companies waste millions making things
nobody wants, hoping to manipulate you into buying them. Central Planning is a
dictatorship where the state tells you what you need. Hîsyêô uses a third way:
**Participatory Planning**.
- **How it works:** Think of the entire economy like a giant **Kickstarter** or
  **Pre-order** system. Once a year, consumers indicate what they want to buy,
  and worker councils indicate what they want to make.
- **The Market Logic:** We match supply and demand *before* production starts.
  This eliminates waste, recessions, and overproduction while ensuring that you
  (the consumer) still drive the economy, not a bureaucrat.

---

In intentional communities or communes, individual freedom often dies under the
weight of social pressure. If everything is free, your neighbors might judge you
for taking "too much" or wanting something unique. Hîsyêô solves this by
formalizing your right to consume. We believe that true freedom isn't about
hiding your choices; it is about having a system that explicitly validates them
so you never have to feel ashamed of your needs.
- **How it works:** your ability to consume is guaranteed by your contribution
  to the plan. When you spend your credits, you aren't "taking" from the
  community; you are redeeming a promise the community made to you. Because the
  system handles the logistics—ensuring there is enough for everyone—you don't
  need to ask your neighbors for permission. If your needs change, you simply
  update your plan. The system tracks these changes not to judge you, but to
  ensure the supply chain adjusts to meet your new reality.
- **The Market Logic:** Money in a market acts as a "permission slip": if you
  can pay for it, nobody can tell you no. Hîsyêô keeps this utility. The
  combination of your work effort and your budget acts as your permission slip.
  It transforms consumption from a moral debate into a simple, logistical
  transaction. As long as you stay within your budget, you don't need to ask for
  permission. You earned it, you balanced it, it's yours.

:::tip Social Tyranny

Readers of Ursula K. Le Guin's *The Dispossessed* will recognize that this is an
attempt to solve the problem of "egoizing." On the planet Anarres, there was no
currency, so consumption was regulated by shame and social tyranny. By keeping a
formal accounting system (credits and planning), Hîsyêô protects the individual
from the tyranny of the group.

Hîsyêô isn't about abolishing the concept of "earning" or "buying." It is about
creating a fair game where the rules apply to everyone, the prices don't lie,
and work is genuinely rewarded.

### What about my country and my ethnicity?

In Hîsyêô theology, nation-states are considered **Shards**—remnants of the
[First Law](./religion/first-law) that enforce artificial borders. However, we
love culture (food, music, stories, and traditions) as vital threads in the
**Great Weave** of diversity.

We embrace culture only if it does not reflect Shards of domination or
superiority. We believe that culture can be a conscious, creative process rather
than something driven by tradition alone. You are invited to bring the best
parts of your heritage into the Weave, while leaving the Shards of hierarchy
behind.

### Why have a con-culture at all?

Many auxiliary languages fail because they are intentionally "soulless". They
believe that you can bridge communication by a shared code alone. In reality,
across languages and even dialects, the meanings of words can often be wildly
different. By leaving culture out of the equation, the community members would
be required to learn the worldview of the native languages of their peers and
that defeats the whole purpose of having a shared language. Hîsyêô includes a
"batteries-included" culture (religion, holidays, metaphors) to give speakers
something to talk about and a shared set of values to bond over. It creates a
"community of intent."

## Religion & Spirituality

### What about my religion?

You do not need to "convert" to Hîsyêô. The "Gods" of Hîsyêô are Archetypes of
the [Divine Mind](./religion/metaphysics#the-divine-mind).

If you are **Atheist**, view them as metaphors for human drives (Empathy, Curiosity, Labor).

If you are **Religious**, you can view them as aspects of your own deity or as
cultural figures. The "Religion" is a framework for **ethics** (how we treat
each other) and **metaphysics** (how we view the universe), not a demand for
worship.

### Is this a cult?

No.

- There is no central leader (creating a hierarchy is the [Sin](./religion/beliefs#sin) of **Domination**).
- There is no financial requirement.
- You can leave at any time, there are no doors.
- We encourage **questioning** (domain of [Suluswutî](./religion/gods/tîêngûun)) of all rules, including our own.

## Miscellaneous 

### Can I invent new words?

**Unlikely**. The culture focuses on building compounds from the existing roots.
Only when a compound becomes heavily used and egregiously long will a new root
word be considered. Even then, it requires **consensus** among the community to
be added to the official lexicon. This ensures the language stays small and
learnable.

:::danger No Judgment Zone

We explicitly do **not** police grammar or attack unofficial word usage. This
kind of correction is an authoritarian Shard that stifles learning. SLA (Second
Language Acquisition) theory shows that learners need to feel safe to acquire a
language.

If you encounter a word you don't recognize:
- Ask the learner what they mean.
- If it's a new invention, acknowledge it without judgment.
- Suggest a common compound for that meaning or offer your own.
- Move on. The goal is communication, not perfection.

### How do I type the special characters?

**Mobile:** Long-press the vowel keys (o -> ô).

**Desktop:** Use the US-International keyboard layout or copy-paste from our
tools. There are a few other options in the works, as well.
