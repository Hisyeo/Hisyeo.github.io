# Political Science

Political Science is the study of <HisyeoWord is='kon'/> <HisyeoWord is='bôklôn'/> (governance/statecraft).
In Hîsyêô, this discipline is inextricably linked to the theology of
[Tîengûun](../religion/gods/tîêngûun) (Society) and the rejection of the [First
Law](../religion/first-law) (Tyranny).

## Core Concepts

The fundamental question of Hîsyêô politics is not "Who rules?" but "How do we agree?"

| English   | Hîsyêô                                   | Literal Meaning                   |

## Systems of Governance

Hîsyêô vocabulary distinguishes between hierarchical systems (Shards) and
horizontal systems (Weaves).

### Hierarchical Systems (The Shards)

- <HisyeoText><strong>Monarchy:</strong> kon bôklôn yê kut&emsp;<small>(Governance of one)</small></HisyeoText>
- <HisyeoText><strong>Oligarchy:</strong> kon bôklôn yê yoûtî&emsp;<small>(Governance of a few)</small></HisyeoText>
- <HisyeoText><strong>Empire:</strong> kûôcyo cênbô&emsp;<small>(Big nation/state)</small></HisyeoText>
- <HisyeoText><strong>Tyranny:</strong> odigon ûlzo&emsp;<small>(Excessive power)</small></HisyeoText>

### Horizontal Systems (The Weave)

- <HisyeoText><strong>Democracy:</strong> kon bôklôn yê môî&emsp;<small>(Rule of all)</small></HisyeoText>
- <HisyeoText><strong>Republic:</strong> kûôcyo yê umo&emsp;<small>(Nation of the people)</small></HisyeoText>
- <HisyeoText><strong>Federation:</strong> mozulis kûngîyo&emsp;<small>(Nation council)</small></HisyeoText>
- <HisyeoText><strong>Commune:</strong> niwos fîmôsyôs&emsp;<small>(Communal residence)</small></HisyeoText>

### Participatory Economics & Politics

Hîsyêô culture advocates for a system known as Participatory Economics (ParEcon)
and Participatory Politics (ParPolity). This system seeks to maintain individual
autonomy and market efficiency without the corruption of capitalism or the
authoritarianism of central planning.

#### The Problem with the Invisible Hand

In Hîsyêô philosophy, the "Invisible Hand" of capitalism is seen as a Shard—a
remnant of the First Law that prioritizes profit (accumulation) over people
(multiplicity). It creates a hierarchy where the market dictates the value of a
life.

#### The Solution: Participatory Planning

Instead of an invisible hand, Hîsyêô uses the Visible Hand of
Tîengûun—conscious, collective planning.

- **Participatory Planning:** <HisyeoText>kon yôcno zomo&emsp;<small>(Group
  planning).</small></HisyeoText> Producers and consumers negotiate directly to determine what is
  produced, ensuring that supply meets need without waste or exploitation.
- **Social Ownership:** <HisyeoText>fuî fîmôsyôs&emsp;<small>(Communal
  ownership).</small></HisyeoText> The means of production (factories, land) are owned by the
  community as a whole, preventing the rise of a capitalist class.
- **Self-Management:** <HisyeoText>kon hûkun cizî&emsp;<small>(Self-rule).</small></HisyeoText> Every
  worker has a say in the decisions that affect their work, proportional to how
  much they are affected.
- **Remuneration for Effort:** <HisyeoText>cifû fun mêdûson</HisyeoText> (Pay
  per effort). People are paid based on the effort and sacrifice of their labor,
  not on the value of their property or genetic luck.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nûs li êo yôcno til yôûlî yê môî til yôk wîlûwo în gomî yê kut.&emsp;<em>We plan for the benefit of all, not for the profit of one.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Political Actors

| English      | Hîsyêô                             | Literal Meaning    |
|--------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Citizen      | <HisyeoText>kukwon zomî</HisyeoText> | Society Member    |
| Leader       | <HisyeoText>ônî obûlû</HisyeoText> | The guiding one       |
| Ruler / King | <HisyeoText>ônî hûkun</HisyeoText> | The ruling one     |
| Council      | <HisyeoWord is='mozulis'/>         | Council / Assembly |
| Activist     | <HisyeoText>ônî fôlnî</HisyeoText> | The free one    |

### The Process of Consensus (Tîengûun)

In Hîsyêô culture, decision-making follows a cycle of Consensus rather than simple voting (which is seen as the tyranny of the majority).

- **Proposal:** <HisyeoText>yôcno nêôs&emsp;<small>(New plan)</small></HisyeoText>
- **Discussion:** <HisyeoText>kon kôto&emsp;<small>(Speech/Dialogue)</small></HisyeoText>
- **Dissent:** <HisyeoText>bêsnêhot în kôntêsto&emsp;<small>(Opposing suggestions)</small></HisyeoText>
- **Agreement:** <HisyeoWord is='wofok'/>

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nûs kôs wofok yê yoldûn til môî.&emsp;<em>We make agreements to help everyone.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### International Relations

- **War:** <HisyeoText>gûexo&emsp;<small>(Conflict/War)</small></HisyeoText>
- **Peace:** <HisyeoText>sontî&emsp;<small>(Calmness)</small></HisyeoText>
- **Foreigner:** <HisyeoText>ônî bolutê&emsp;<small>(The foreign one)</small></HisyeoText>
