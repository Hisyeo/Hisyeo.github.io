# Philosophy

Philosophy is the study of tolîko kon oncêmon (perspective). In Hîsyêô, philosophy is not an academic exercise but a practical toolkit for dismantling the Shards of tyranny in one's own mind. It is the domain of [Suluswutî](../religion/gods/suluswutî) (The Questioner) and [Xôcibîlî](../religion/gods/xôcibîlî) (The Reflector).

## Epistemology (Study of Knowledge)

Epistemology explores the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge, asking how we know what we know.

### Major Schools

- **Empiricism:** Knowledge comes from <HisyeoWord is='dêko'/> (observation) and <HisyeoWord is='dênêmêk'/> (testing). This aligns with the Scientific Method.

- **Rationalism:** Knowledge comes from <HisyeoWord is='montûksol'/> (reason) and the structure of the mind itself.

- **Constructivism:** Reality is a <HisyeoWord is='wofok'/> (agreement) constructed by society.

  **Hîsyêô Perspective:** The [First Law](../religion/first-law) represents absolute, static Truth (Platonism). The [Shattering](../religion/shattering) introduced Multiplicity, favoring **Nominalism**—universals are just names we give to collections of unique things.

## Ethics (Study of Right Action)

Ethics explores the question: **How should we live?**

### Major Frameworks

- **Deontology:** Rules and duties. "Do what is right because it is the rule." (Associated with the First Law's rigidity).

- **Utilitarianism:** The greatest good for the greatest number.

- **Virtue Ethics:** Cultivating character traits of [Bostet](../religion/gods/bostet) (the emodiment of Empathy) and of <HisyeoWord is='fôgîcîn'/> (Curiosity).

  **Hîsyêô Perspective:** Hîsyêô ethics rejects the binary of "Good" and "Evil." Instead, actions are evaluated by <HisyeoWord is='ûsowo'/> (Equity/Balance) and <HisyeoWord is='yoldûn'/> (Help/Aid). Justice is not punishment; it is the restoration of the Weave.

## Metaphysics (Study of Existence)

In general philosophy, this field asks *What is real?*

- **Materialism:** Only matter (<HisyeoWord is='kûsowî'/>) exists. The mind is a machine (<HisyeoWord is='culono'/>).

- **Idealism:** Only the mind (<HisyeoWord is='dûuncît'/>) exists. Matter is a dream (<HisyeoWord is='hôlmo'/>).

- **Dualism:** Mind and Matter are separate substances.

  **Hîsyêô Perspective:** Hîsyêô is **Panpsychist**. Consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe (The Divine Mind), and matter is the "Dream" of the [Cosmic Soul](../religion/metaphysics#the-cosmic-soul).

## Political Philosophy

The study of power (<HisyeoWord is='hûkun'/>) and society (<HisyeoWord is='zomî'/>).

- **Anarchism:** The rejection of hierarchy (<HisyeoWord is='dês'/> <HisyeoWord is='hûkun'/>). Order arises from free agreement (<HisyeoWord is='wofok'/> <HisyeoWord is='zomo'/> <HisyeoWord is='mûlû'/>).

- **Socialism:** Social ownership of the means of production (<HisyeoWord is='fuî'/> <HisyeoWord is='fîmôsyôs'/>).

- **Liberalism:** Focus on individual rights and the social contract.

  **Hîsyêô Perspective:** The culture is **Anti-Authoritarian** but structurally organized. It rejects the State (centralized command) as a "Shard" of the [First Law](../religion/first-law), but it embraces the Participatory Network of the Weave. It utilizes markets and price signals to coordinate complex needs, but these are managed through collective planning (domain of [Tîengûun](../religion/gods/tîêngûun)) rather than capitalist accumulation. The goal is individual autonomy within a robust, non-coercive support structure.

## Aesthetics (Study of Beauty)

What is beauty (<HisyeoWord is='hosîn'/>)?

- **Objectivism:** Beauty is inherent in the object; symmetry (<HisyeoWord is='ûsowo'/>) or order (<HisyeoWord is='ôdon'/>).

- **Subjectivism:** Beauty is in the eye of the beholder (<HisyeoWord is='oncêmon'/> <HisyeoWord is='umo'/>).

  **Hîsyêô Perspective:** Hîsyêô culture has a very open perspective on beauty but there is an incliination towards appreciating vitality and function. A static, perfect crystal is less beautiful than a messy, growing forest (Dimîtu).
