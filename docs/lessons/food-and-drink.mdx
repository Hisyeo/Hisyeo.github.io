# Food & Drink

Food is a central part of culture and community. In Hîsyêô, talking about food involves distinguishing between the ingredients (<HisyeoWord is='oksûn'/>, <HisyeoWord is='ûnfûnô'/>) and the prepared meals (<HisyeoWord is='côûfon'/>).

## Basic Actions

There are several primary verbs you will use constantly when discussing food.

| English    | Hîsyêô | Usage Notes                                                                               |
|------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| To Eat     | <HisyeoWord is='mokon'/>  | Used for solid food.                                                                      |
| To Drink   | <HisyeoWord is='îskô'/>   | Used for liquid food. Also functions as the noun "beverage"                                  |
| To Cook    | <HisyeoWord is='côûfon'/> | Used for the act of preparing a full meal. Also functions as the noun "meal"             |
| To Bake    | <HisyeoWord is='bîek'/>   | Used for the act of cooking in an oven. Also functions as the noun "baked good" or "bread." |
| To Prepare | <HisyeoWord is='ondo'/>   | Used for preparing sub-elements or ingredients. Also functions as the noun "preparation." |
| To Smell   | <HisyeoWord is='unon'/>   | To perceive a smell. Also functionas as the noun "scent"                                       |
| To Taste   | <HisyeoWord is='sobôlê'/> | To perceive a flavor. Also functions as the noun "flavor"                                     |

:::caution Intransitivity

English has its own polysemous verbs that become *intransitive* and copulative, indicating that the subject has a sensory quality which
you would sense if using the transitive form of the verb. This is **not** how verbs work in Hîsyêô because there is no [intransivity](../language/word_types/verbs.mdx#intransivity). 

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo unon îskô hôktun ulyô ûn û ni li lôc.&emsp;<em>I smelled that milk and it is bad.</em></p>
    <p>û îskô hôktun ulyô li lôc.&emsp;<em>That milk smells bad.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

:::

:::tip "Hungry" and "Thirsty"
Hîsyêô does not have specific adjectives for "hungry" or "thirsty." Instead, you express the desire to perform the action.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p><em>I am hungry.</em>&emsp;noyo fôlun xe mokon.&emsp;<small>(I want to eat.)</small></p>
    <p><em>I am thirsty.</em>&emsp;noyo fôlun xe îskô.&emsp;<small>(I want to drink.)</small></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Place Setting

The tools used for eating are named after the specific action they perform.

| English       | Hîsyêô      | Literal Meaning  | Action Verb        |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Plate         | <HisyeoText>sîêtô      </HisyeoText> |                  |                    |
| Cup / Bowl    | <HisyeoText>xolu       </HisyeoText> |                  |                    |

| Knife         | <HisyeoText>ônî wêtû   </HisyeoText> | The cutting one  | <HisyeoWord is='wêtû'/> (to cut)      |

### Describing Flavor & Smell

Unlike simple descriptions using "is" (<HisyeoWord is='li'/>), describing the sensory experience of food uses the verbs <HisyeoWord is='sobôlê'/> (to taste) and <HisyeoWord is='unon'/> (to smell) as possessed qualities (noun form).

**Structure:**

> [Food Subject]&emsp;+&emsp;<HisyeoWord is='fuî'/>&emsp;+&emsp;<HisyeoWord is='sobôlê'/>&emsp;+&emsp;[Adjective]&emsp;*The food has [Adjective] flavor.*

| Adjective      | Hîsyêô                     | Example                                                                         |

| Good / Yummy   | <HisyeoWord is='xôn'/>     | <HisyeoText>û bîek fuî sobôlê xôn.</HisyeoText> (The bread tastes yummy.)       |
| Bad / Yucky    | <HisyeoWord is='lôc'/>     | <HisyeoText>undofôl fuî unon lôc</HisyeoText> (The beans smell yucky.)          |
| Sweet          | <HisyeoWord is='kûkmut'/>  | <HisyeoText>kûôxi fuî sobôlê kûkmut.</HisyeoText> (The fruit tastes sweet.)     |
| Salty          | <HisyeoWord is='xôboî'/>   | <HisyeoText>oksûn fuî sobôlê xôboî.</HisyeoText> (The meat tastes salty.)       |
| Tart / Tangy   | <HisyeoWord is='mûncû'/>   | <HisyeoText>îskô fuî sobôlê mûncû.</HisyeoText> (The drinks taste tart.)        |
| Bitter         | <HisyeoWord is='kîkôlô'/>  | <HisyeoText>kûu sobôlê kîkôlô.</HisyeoText> (Coffee tastes bitter.)             |
| Savory / Umami | <HisyeoWord is='ûmomî'/>   | <HisyeoText>côûfon sobôlê ûmomî.</HisyeoText> (The meal tastes savory.)         |
| Spicy          | <HisyeoWord is='bîkontê'/> | <HisyeoText>ûnfûnô fuî unon bîkontê.</HisyeoText> (The vegetables smell spicy.) |

## Meals of the Day

Meals are generally described by combining the word for "meal" (<HisyeoWord is='côûfon'/>) with the time of day.

| English   | Hîsyêô                                 | Literal Meaning |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Breakfast | <HisyeoText>côûfon hêlxun</HisyeoText> | Morning meal    |

| Dessert   | <HisyeoText>côûfon sûît  </HisyeoText> | Sweet Meal      |

## At the Restaurant

Dining out involves a specific set of vocabulary and social scripts between the staff and the guests.

### Terminology

| English      | Hîsyêô                                      | Literal Meaning   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Restaurant   | <HisyeoText>gubuyo côûfon     </HisyeoText> | Meal store        |
| Menu         | <HisyeoText>tômôs côûfon      </HisyeoText> | Meal book         |
| Table        | <HisyeoText>mîêbil în mokon   </HisyeoText> | Eating Furniture  |
| Bill / Check | <HisyeoText>mîkdol mûlû       </HisyeoText> | Full amount       |
| Tip          | <HisyeoText>munî yôûlî        </HisyeoText> | Beneficial money  |
| Server       | <HisyeoText>ônî yoldûn        </HisyeoText> | The helping one   |
| Cook         | <HisyeoText>ônî côûfon        </HisyeoText> | The cooking one   |
| Chef         | <HisyeoText>ônî ondo yê côûfon</HisyeoText> | Prepaper of meals |

### Cultural Etiquette

In Hîsyêô culture, dining is an act of shared liberty, and service is never viewed as servitude.

**Equality:** The server is an <HisyeoWord is='ônî'/> <HisyeoWord is='yoldûn'/> (one who helps), a peer who is facilitating your experience. You should address them with the same respect you would a friend (<HisyeoWord is='sûtûô'/>).

**Attention:** In line with the ethics of Simone Weil, guests are expected to pay attention to the staff as people. Eye contact and using <HisyeoWord is='nîmû'/> (you) rather than just barking orders is the standard.

**Reciprocity:** The <HisyeoWord is='munî'/> <HisyeoWord is='yôûlî'/> (tip) is not a wage supplement (as basic needs are met in the community model), but a gesture of <HisyeoWord is='yôûlî'/> (help/aid) given in gratitude for exceptional care.

### Customer Interactions

As a guest, you will primarily interact with the <HisyeoWord is='ônî'/> <HisyeoWord is='yoldûn'/> (server).

#### Ordering
To ask for something politely, use <HisyeoWord is='noyo'/> <HisyeoWord is='fôlun'/> (I want) or an interrogative <HisyeoWord is='noyo'/> <HisyeoWord is='kôî'/> <HisyeoWord is='dôstoc'/> (Could I receive...). Using <HisyeoWord is='lôtfen'/> (please/polite) is highly encouraged to show respect.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo fôlun kûôxi lôtfen.&emsp;<em>I would like fruit, please.</em></p>
    <p>noyo kôî dôstoc yoûtî xîmu ko?&emsp;<em>Could I get some water?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Payment
When you are finished, you will need to ask for the bill.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû kôî bîek mîkdol mûlû ko?&emsp;<em>Can you total the bill?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Chef & Server Interactions

Behind the scenes, the staff coordinates to ensure service is smooth.

#### The Pass (Handing off food)


<HisyeoTabs>
    <p><strong>Server:</strong>&emsp;¿ondo sî côûfon til mîêbil dûî ko?&emsp;<em>Is the meal for table two ready/finished?</em></p>
    <p><strong>Chef:</strong>&emsp;ondo sî. kûu gomî ôfo.&emsp;<em>Finished. Take this.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Service Issues

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p><strong>Server:</strong>&emsp;mîêbil niswî buswen eswen xîmu.&emsp;<em>Table three needs more water.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
