# Greetings & Salutations

How to say hello, introduce yourself and describe where you're from.

## Verbs & Gerunds.

Meeting someone involves the verb <HisyeoWord is='monodo'/> and a usage of a
subordinate clause (an inner sentence). The subordinate clause acts similar to a
[gerund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund) would in English, meaning that it 
allows you to refer to the action of the verb as a noun.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>.&emsp;<em></em>Playing on computers is awesome.</p>
    <p>lı küzoü ü xe kelo fio öni tüek.&emsp;<em>It is awesome to play on computers.</em></p>
    <p>noyo süko xe kelo fio öni tüek.&emsp;<em>I like playing on computers.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Starting the first sentence with a subordinate clause requires that you use a
pause (a comma, orthographically) to ensure that the listener understands this
to be an inner clause of the sentence. However, second example doesn't start the
with a subject and instead provideds it *after* the verb (<HisyeoWord is='lı'/>)
by using the subject preposition (<HisyeoWord is='ü'/>). This allows you to
introduce the subordinate clause at the end of the sentence which reduces the
need for the pause when speaking. In the third sentence, since the subordinate
clause is being provided as the object of the verb, it also is the last argument
of the sentence and avoids the need for a pause.

## Meet & Greet

Now with some grammar under our belt, let's learn how to meet and greet your
fellow Hisyëans!

### Meeting Someone

In the first sentence, we are using a simple sentence with a transitive verb,
two pronouns and a preposition that is marking time. In the next sentence, we
are using a deontic verb phrase coupled with propositive sentence ender to
indicate the sentence describes a desired future and that the speaker is looking
for agreement or approval from the listener. The sentence also uses the
beneficiary/purpose preposition indicating what the meeting is for. Finally, the
last sentence is where we make use of a subjective subordinate clause to
describe the desiring (the verb of the main predicate) of an action (the
subjective subordinate clause).

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo monodo niün hoi suhot dus.&emsp;<em>I am meeting them at 10</em></p>
    <p>nü küu monodo oxon cöüfon bıtün ci.&emsp;<em>Let's meet for supper, sound good?</em></p>
    <p>nimü fölun xe monodo noyo hoi cıhöü ko.&emsp;<em>Do you want to meet me later?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### How To Greet

For the initial contact with another person, there are some common expressions
used as pleasantries. Each one uses a subjective subordinate clause as the
experiencer of a complement. In the first and last sentences, the complement is
adjectival. In the middle sentence, the complement is unsaid and instead an
adverb is provided. This kind of sentence structure allows you to link an adverb
to the action inside of the subjective subordinate clause.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>lı xön ü xe monodo nimü löicök.&emsp;<em>It is so nice to meet you.</em></p>
    <p>bı yübik ü xe monodo nimü.&emsp;<em>Lovely to meet you.</em></p>
    <p>lı xön ëto ü xe dëko nimü.&emsp;<em>It is great to see you.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

    <p>lı xön ü xe monodo nimü ütok.&emsp;<em>It is nice to meet you too.</em></p>
