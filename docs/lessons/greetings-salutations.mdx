# Greetings & Salutations

How to say hello, introduce yourself and describe where you're from.

## Verbs & Gerunds.

Meeting someone involves the verb <HisyeoWord is='monodo'/> and a usage of a
subordinate clause (an inner sentence). The subordinate clause acts similar to a
[gerund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund) would in English, meaning that it 
allows you to refer to the action of the verb as a noun.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>xe kelo tö öni tüek, lı küzoü.&emsp;<em></em>Playing on computers is awesome.</p>
    <p>lı küzoü ü xe kelo tö öni tüek.&emsp;<em>It is awesome to play on computers.</em></p>
    <p>noyo süko xe kelo tö öni tüek.&emsp;<em>I like playing on computers.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Starting the first sentence with a subordinate clause requires that you use a
pause (a comma, orthographically) to ensure that the listener understands this
to be an inner clause of the sentence. However, second example doesn't start the
with a subject and instead provideds it *after* the verb (<HisyeoWord is='lı'/>)
by using the subject preposition (<HisyeoWord is='ü'/>). This allows you to
introduce the subordinate clause at the end of the sentence which reduces the
need for the pause when speaking. In the third sentence, since the subordinate
clause is being provided as the object of the verb, it also is the last argument
of the sentence and avoids the need for a pause.

## Meet & Greet

Now with some grammar under our belt, let's learn how to meet and greet your
fellow Hisyëans! We will try to describe some of the characteristics of the
different sentences being used in the examples. Feel free to skip over that if
you want to just focus in on learning the phrases.

### Meeting Someone

In the first sentence, we are using a simple sentence with a transitive verb,
two pronouns. This is your standard subject, verb, object sentence. With the
addition of one preposition at the end.

In the next sentence, we are using a deontic verb phrase coupled with
propositive sentence ender. The deontic verb phrase marker indicates the
sentence describes a *desired future*. The propositive sentence ender indicates
the speaker is looking for agreement or approval from the listener. The sentence
also uses the beneficiary/purpose preposition indicating what the meeting is
for.

Finally, the last sentence is where we make use of a subjective subordinate
clause we learned about above. It indicates that an action is what is *desired*
(the verb of the main predicate).

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo monodo niün hoi suhot dus.&emsp;<em>I am meeting them at 10</em></p>
    <p>nü küu monodo oxon cöüfon bıtün ci.&emsp;<em>Let's meet for supper, sound good?</em></p>
    <p>nimü fölun xe monodo noyo hoi cıhöü ko.&emsp;<em>Do you want to meet me later?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### How To Greet

For the initial contact with another person, there are some common expressions
used as pleasantries. Each one uses a subjective subordinate clause as the
experiencer of an adjectival complement.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>lı xön ü xe monodo nimü löicök.&emsp;<em>It is so nice to meet you.</em></p>
    <p>lı xön ëto ü xe dëko nimü.&emsp;<em>It is great to see you.</em></p>
    <p>lı cömël ü xe monodo nimü.&emsp;<em>Lovely to meet you.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Responding To A Greeting

The standard "thank you" can be interpreted as either being subjectless or a
first-person subject drop. The context preposition indicates that the
thankfulness is concerning that marked object. Use adjectives on the
thankfulness to expand on the meaning. In the third example, we are interpeting
the "much" as being adverbial (i.e., they have been thankful many times) and the
added emphasis sentence ender is being used to represent "so".

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>lı konxo hön nimü.<em>Thank you.</em></p>
    <p>lı konxo ëto hön nimü.<em>Many thanks to you.</em></p>
    <p>lı konxo bı ëto löicök.&emsp;<em>Thank you so much.</em></p>
    <p>oxon noyo ütok.&emsp;<em>For me also.</em></p>
    <p>lı xön ü xe monodo nimü ütok.&emsp;<em>It is nice to meet you too.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### When You'll Meet Again

Here, we are intepreting the mood in the English sentence as being deontic and
the added ender of "ok?" is being filled by the propositive sentence ender. In
the second sentence, we are interpeting the mood in the English sentence as
being epistemic and the question word also means that it is effectively
interrogative as well. In the third sentence, you have to be careful to remember
that the second verb is being intepreted as the object of the active verb
preposition. The fourth sentence makes use of the interrogative sentence ender.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nü küu monodo bı dizel zelen ci.&emsp;<em>Let's meet again soon, ok?</em></p>
    <p>hoi woküt zık ü noyo köi dëko nimü bı dizel.&emsp;<em>When can I see you again?</em></p>
    <p>nü köi döstoc iskö hoi bıtün yë lono unbol ci.&emsp;<em>We could get a drink on Saturday night, sound good?</em></p>
    <p>nimü lı fölni hoi suhot tukwos yë bıtün öfo ko.&emsp;<em>Are you free at 8pm tonight?</em></p>
    <p>noyo xiwon xe dëko nimü bı zelen ëto löicök.&emsp;<em>I so hope to see you very soon!</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
