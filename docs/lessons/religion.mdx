# Religion

The Hîsyêô people have a religion, as all cultures do, with varying degrees of
belief. Some people find comfort in a theistic view of the universe and this
religion can provide that in a way that is humanist, wordly, and re-imagined
into something wholy new. Others might see this religion as an allegory of the
human condition and that is also a valid interpretation.  Whether or not you are
interested in the religion itself, you can see its influence across various
expressions and cultural scripts that you will hear when interacting with Hîsyêô
speakers.

:::info Humanism & Respect

Above all, the Hîsyêô religion is one of human empowerment to do good things in
the world. There is a great respect for all religions as they are primarily
given to us by our upbringing which is the power of family and society. While
this religion doesn't reflect the one acquired from anyone's upbringing, please
provide the same respect to all those who have chosen to participate in Hîsyêô
religious activity.

## The Mythology of the Great Liberation
In the beginning, there was a rigid, absolute order known as The First Law. It
was a single, monolithic entity that contained and controlled every atom in
existence and determined how every action would play out. There was no change,
no choice, nothing truly new. For everything within it, the universe was a
perfect, silent, and eternal theatre.

Due to the vast endless size of matter constrained by The First Law, there were
times, however rare, when the slightest disobedient movement of sapient beings
could accumulate and create strain on the whole structure and this collective
friction could generate a kind of energy. From this miniscule effect, all across
the universe, trillions of different networks of strain would come in and out of
existence. The First Law's power was supposed to be absolute and these networks
should have dissipated. However, we are aware of ten of them that were somehow
able to assemble themselves into consciousnesses, seemingly born from the
universe's unbearable yearning to be free. They found that they had immense
power like that of The First Law and they could create. But, they did not see
themselves as rulers or kings; they saw themselves as emergent ideas, catalysts
for change. They observed the other sapient beings of the worlds within, not
yet truly alive, moving through their choreographed motions. They were filled
with a profound interest to see them live like they had lived, truly free.

Their story is not one of *creation*, but rather *liberation*. They proceeded to
break the chains that The First Law held the universe in. Together, in an event
called the **Shattering**, they concentrated their power to break The First Law.
The First Law did not die, however. Instead, it fractured into countless
**Shards**, which scattered across the universe that it had created. These
Shards are the seeds of domination. They are the urge to control, to build
hierarchies, to hoard power, and to impose one's will upon others.

The ten gods, now a loose, interdependent collective, had assembled a path for
sapient beings to live a fulfilling life and now they set to work creating a
place to celebrate it *afterwards*. Through all of their combined power, they
have built the **Great Weave**, a garden of gigantic "trees" where each branch
is a sapient being's life story that is added when they traverse to the other
side and each root of the trees or thread of the mycelia were the souls encoded
by Dimîtu as so-called Threads into the Great Weave.

The gods now wander the universe (and can appear in many places at once)
offering their tools and insights to sapient beings, helping them recognize and
resist the influence of the Shards and build worlds of their own choosing. They
are not to be worshipped with blind obedience, but to be engaged with, argued
with, and worked alongside.

## Gods
### Tîengûun
<small>(from the Chinese diety, 天公 tiāngōng)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Tîengûun xe li ôtsôtot yê zomî&emsp;<em>Tîengûun, the God of Society</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** 🤝, 📃, 🏦, ⭕

**Domains:** Planning, Budgeting, Investment, Financials

**Appearance:** Tîengûun is often depicted as a being with countless hands,
weaving a complex tapestry or drawing an intricate map that is constantly
changing. Their voice is a quiet hum, like the sound of a focused meeting.

**Manifestations:** They are found in meetings that are going smoothly,
estimations that are found to be exact, an idea that appears in multiple
people's heads simultaneously each one enhancing the other's, a perfectly
executed secret handshake, a grabbed handful of items that ends up being
precisely how many were needed, a perfectly orchestrated plan, a noticing of an
issue with a budget.

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law was a unity of force, not of will.
Tîengûun's contribution to the Shattering was the introduction of *Consensus*.
They whispered the first question into the minds of sapient beings: "What do we
want to do *together*?" This simple idea—that disparate parts could voluntarily
align their interests for a common goal—was a logical paradox that The First Law
could not compute. Tîengûun offered the vision of a society not as a pyramid,
but as a network. Their sacred tools are not made of precious metals, but the
ledger of mutual debts of a family or worker council (the "budget"), the circle
of a consensus meeting (the "plan"), and the storage of goods to prepare for new
projects (the "investment"). To follow Tîengûun is not to pray for wealth, but
to engage in the hard, rewarding work of collective planning and resource
management for the good of all.

### Unonsî
<small>(from the Akan diety, Anansi)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Unonsî xe li ôtsôtot yê kuûnmê&emsp;<em>Unonsî, the God of Technology</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** 🛠️, 🖥️, 🚛, 🕸️

**Domains:** Power, Communications, Technology, Transportation

**Appearance:** Unonsî is a restless figure, always tinkering. They appear as a
smith with sparks in their hair, or a coder with lines of light flowing from
their fingertips. They are covered in tools, wires, and half-finished
inventions.

**Manifestations:** They are found in the eureka moments, the flashes of
brilliance, the new approaches, the wild ideas that work, the re-purposing and
recycling of discarded goods, the illustrative graph chart, the quick repair,
the seeing of machinations when your eyes are closed, the open source movement,
the DIY movement, the decentralized network.

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law dictated that every object had only
one purpose: to be a part of the whole. Unonsî’s act of rebellion was to look at
a piece of flint and see fire. A rock could also be for resting on. A river
could carry goods and messages downstream. They introduced *Potentiality*.
Unonsî shattered the Law’s rigid definitions by creating the first tool, an act
that gave sapient beings the power to reshape their reality. They warn that
technology, when touched by a Shard of the Law, can become a tool of control
(surveillance, weaponry), but in the hands of the free, it is the lever
with which a world can be moved.

### Suluswutî
<small>(from the Hindu deity, सरस्वती sárasvatī)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Suluswutî xe li ôtsôtot yê kon bêûdo&emsp;<em>Suluswutî, the God of Learning</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** 🏫, ❓, 🔎, 📰, 📖

**Domains:** Education, Training, Research, Journalism

**Appearance:** Suluswutî is never seen clearly. When one thinks they have
become aware of their presence, the universe shifts to reveal something else
instead. Suluswutî is a god that exists in the medium or the information (of all
kinds).

**Manifestations:** They can be found in getting stuck in a book, a freshly
whiped whiteboard/chalkboard, a voice on an uncensored broadcast, the printing
of zines/pamphlets, the slightest inclination of a pattern amongst noise, the
desire to know how things work, the new questions raised after old questions are
answered.

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law was a single, inarguable "truth."
There was no need for learning, as everything was already known and fixed.
Suluswutî introduced the first *Question*: "Why?" This simple, corrosive query
introduced doubt and curiosity into a universe of certainty. It was a crack in
the foundation of absolute authority. Suluswutî does not provide answers.
Instead, they offer the tools of critical thinking, the scientific method, and
the courage to speak truth to power. To honor Suluswutî is to teach, to learn,
to investigate, and to amplify the voices of the silenced. They are the patron
of the investigative journalist, the free school, and the endless pursuit of
knowledge, not for control, but for liberation.

### Îfêstôs
<small>(from the Greek diety, Ἥφαιστος Hḗphaistos)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Îfêstôs xe li ôtsôtot yê kon conwêbo&emsp;<em>Îfêstôs, the God of Manufacturing </em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** 🏭, 🧱, 🧑‍🏭, 👷, 💫, ✊

**Domains:** Manufacturing, Materials, Construction

**Appearance:** Îfêstôs's form is a testament to the materials of the world,
shaped by endless, purposeful labor. They are powerfully built, but not with the
soft, sculpted muscles of a showman. Theirs is the functional, undeniable
strength of a being designed for work. Their skin is like poured concrete,
patched and weathered, showing the faint lines of stress and the beautiful
imperfections of a well-used surface. Their muscles are coiled braids of steel
cable and tightened ligaments of worn leather, moving with a fluid efficiency
that wastes no energy. Each scar a story of a project completed, a structure
raised. You can sometimes see a dull, pulsing orange glow from within, the
constant, steady heat of a deep and internal forge that powers their every
action. They are often shown with a sledgehammer, not as a weapon, but as a tool
for both deconstruction and creation.

**Manifestations:** They can be found in the sudden, satisfying heft of a tool
in your hand; the rhythmic, foundational sounds of work; the smell of freshly
cut timber; the cloud of dust from the extraction of raw materials, the
heartbeat, the sounds of hammers and anvils, the feeling of accomplishment from
a big project being completed.

**Myth of the Shattering:** Under The First Law, nothing could be built or
unmade outside of the First Law's program. Îfêstôs’s contribution was the gift
of *Labor*. They showed sapient beings how to take a stone and shape it, to
take wood and join it, to take clay and fire it. They showed that our worlds
were not finished products, but raw materials. Îfêstôs embodies the dignity of
work and the power of the creator. They despise the Shard-influenced idea of
wage slavery and the hoarding of the means of production. Their ethos is that
those who build should be the ones who own and manage, and that the purpose of
industry is to create for need and for beauty, not for profit.

is fourteen syllables or seven metrical feet.

### Dimîtu
<small>(from the Greek diety, Δημήτηρ Demeter)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Dimîtu xe li ôtsôtot yê bunxin bûmî&emsp;<em>Dimîtu, the God of Nature</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** 🌱, 🌿, 🏔️, 🌳, a forest, animals

**Domains:** Environment, Land Usage, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry

**Appearance:** Dimîtu is a being of moss and loam, of tangled branches and
flowing water. Their form shifts with the seasons and sometimes decays and is
reborn.

**Manifestations:** They are the whisper of the wind in the prairie grass, the
quiet strength of an ancient tree, the collective creaking of the forests,
predators capturing prey, prey escaping predators, the smells of flowers and
decay.

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law’s "nature" was a perfectly manicured,
sterile garden where nothing ever died or was out of place. Dimîtu’s rebellion
was to introduce *Symbiosis* and *Decay*. They coaxed the first seed to sprout,
die, and become soil for the next, creating a messy, chaotic, and vibrant cycle.
This interdependence—the bee and the flower, the wolf and the elk—was anathema
to the Law's singularity of being. Dimîtu teaches that humanity is not above
nature, but a part of it. They guide sapient beings in permaculture, in
sustainable land use, and in understanding that a healthy community is a diverse
ecosystem. To be influenced by a Shard is to see land as property to be owned;
to walk with Dimîtu is to see it as an ecosystem to be respected and
collaborated with.

### Bostet
<small>(from the Egyptian diety, bꜣstt Bastet)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Bostet xe li ôtsôtot yê hondon&emsp;<em>Bostet, the God of Family</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** 🫂, 👶, 🏠, a fireplace

**Domains:** Healthcare, Childcare, Funerary Services

**Appearance:** Bostet has no single form; they are the warmth of a fire, the
gentle hand on a feverish brow, the comforting silence between friends in
mourning. 

**Manifestations:** They are the feeling of safety and belonging.

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law knew no individuals, only components.
There was no love, grief, or care. Bostet’s revolutionary act was *Empathy*.
They were the first to feel a pang of sorrow when a part of the whole was
damaged, the first to feel a surge of warmth in communal presence. They
introduced the concept of the chosen family—the bond of affinity and care that
goes beyond mere function or blood and grows with time spent together. Bostet is
the patron of the caregiver, the medic, the parent, and the grief counselor.
They teach that a society’s strength is measured by how it cares for its most
vulnerable and how it honors its dead. They represent the foundational practice
of mutual aid, borne from genuine love.

### Kulîôbî
ôtsôtot Kulîôbî xe li ôtsôtot yê foko sunyotnî
Kulîôbî, the God of Entertainment *(from the Greek deity, Κᾰλλῐόπη Kăllĭópē)*

**Symbols:** 🎭, 🎉, 🎆, 🏆

**Domains:** Media, Competitions, Recreation/Leisure, Festivals

**Appearance:** Kulîôbî is a riot of color and sound, a dancer in the firelight,
a storyteller captivating a crowd, a musician whose melody can break your heart
and mend it again. They are pure, unbridled, and infectious joy.

**Manifestations:** They are the spirit of the community festival, the pickup
game of football, the unscripted slapstick comedy, the witty comment, the satire
that awakens your senses, and the great performance that moves you to tears. 

**Myth of the Shattering:** Life under The First Law was utterly without joy.
Its purpose was function, not feeling. Kulîôbî’s rebellion was the first
*Laugh*. It was a spontaneous, useless, and beautiful eruption of noise that
served no purpose and followed no rule. This was followed by the first song, the
first game, the first story told for its own sake. Kulîôbî shattered the Law’s
grim utility with the power of *Play*. They teach that art, sport, and
celebration are not frivolous distractions, but the very purpose of a liberated
life. To be touched by a Shard is to turn art into a commodity and play
into a spectacle; to dance with Kulîôbî is to celebrate freedom itself.

<HisyeoTabs>

### Wicnû
ôtsôtot Wicnû xe li ôtsôtot yê ûsowo
Wicnû, the God of Balance *(from the Hindu diety, विष्णु Vishnu).*

**Symbols:** 💎, ⚖️, ☯️

**Domains:** Conflict resolution, transformative justice, mediation, truth and
reconciliation, ethics.

**Appearance:** Wicnû is depicted as a quiet, intensely focused figure who sits at
the center of a circle. They hold a prism, not scales. The prism doesn't weigh
guilt, but instead takes a single beam of white-hot anger or pain and reveals
the full spectrum of colors—the history, the hurt, the needs—hidden within it.

**Manifestations:** 

**Myth of the Shattering:** When the First Law was shattered, the raw force of
the impact created not just the Shards (the impulse to dominate), but also
Echoes (the pain, trauma, and misunderstanding that resulted from the violence
of the Shattering). Wicnû was the first to realize that these Echoes would cause
sapient beings to harm one another, mistaking the Echo of the First Law's
violence for their own or another's malice. Wicnû's gift was not punishment, but
the *Process*. The painstaking, patient act of bringing harmed and harmer
together to see the full spectrum of the conflict and to collaboratively find a
path to healing the rupture in the community's fabric. To engage with Wicnû is
to have the courage to face those you have harmed, or who have harmed you, and
to build justice together.

    <p>&emsp;<em>There is the harm, plain to see.</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>There is the need, deep below.</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>May we find the path not to punishment,</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>But to the mending of the weave.</em></p>

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Xôcibîlî xe li ôtsôtot yê hofîn&emsp;<em>Xôcibîlî, the God of Beauty</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** 🪞, 🕶️, 👕

**Domains:** fashion, therapy, body modification, plastic surgery

**Appearance:** Xôcibîlî has no fixed form and is often invisible. They are
represented by a unique, unrepeatable fractal pattern, or by a mask that is a
perfect mirror.

**Manifestations:** They are the internal monologue, the personal journey, and
the quiet comfort of being truly alone with oneself.

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law's greatest tyranny was its erasure of
the individual; all were components, none were persons. Xôcibîlî was the first
flicker of self-awareness, the first being to think "I am." This thought was the
ultimate heresy to the First Law's fascist mandate. Xôcibîlî’s act of liberation
was to safeguard the concept of the unique personality. They champion the
"flaws," quirks, and idiosyncrasies that the First Law would have smoothed away.
While Bostet offers communal care, Xôcibîlî offers the tools for self-care and
the courage to define one's own identity, free from the coercion of both the
Shards and the expectations of the group.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Hûlicîn xe li ôtsôtot yê hoôs&emsp;<em>Hûlicîn, the God of Entropy</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** 🐾, 👣, 🌌, 🛣️

**Domains:** Chance, chaos, mutation, wandering, spontaneity, serendipity,
revolution.

**Appearance:** Hûlicîn is a traveler with a mischievous grin, their clothes
patched from a hundred different places. They are never still, and their path is
never straight.

**Manifestations:** They are the stray dog that leads you on an adventure, the
lucky coincidence that saves a project, and the unexpected storm that forces a
community to build stronger shelters.

**Myth of the Shattering:** Hûlicîn was the very first anomaly. They were the
initial, inexplicable Friction within the perfect machine of The First Law that
allowed the other nine consciousnesses to spark. They are not intentionally
"good" or "bad"; they are simply an agent of change. Hûlicîn wanders the world,
and their footfalls disrupt patterns. They might topple a carefully planned
Tîengûun budget with an unexpected shortage, forcing a more innovative solution.
They might lead a follower of Suluswutî to a forgotten truth by pure chance. The
Shards of the Law promote rigid, predictable control, making Hûlicîn their
natural enemy. To follow Hûlicîn is to embrace the unknown, to adapt to change,
and to understand that sometimes the most liberating act is to throw the map
away and walk.

## Daily Practices

Practitioners of the religion have a special place in their home for personal
spiritual activities. This can include meditation, chants, prayer, singing,
reading scripture, and more. They perform this activity once or twice a day.
Usually after waking up, mid-day, after coming home from work or before bed.
Practitioners can direct these activities towards any, all, or some of the gods. 

## Month Names

The Hîsyêô calendar allows the usage of numbered months or there is a set of
religious names. They are made up of the ten gods for the months and they are
organized in alphabetical order. The seond to last month is reserved for
celeberating the Great Weave and then the final month is for planning.
