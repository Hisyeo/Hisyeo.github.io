# Religion

The Hîsyêô people have a religion, as all cultures do, with varying degrees of
belief. Some people find comfort in a theistic view of the universe and this
religion can provide that in a way that is humanist, wordly, and re-imagined
into something wholy new. Others might see this religion as an allegory of the
human condition and that is also a valid interpretation.  Whether or not you are
interested in the religion itself, you can see its influence across various
expressions and cultural scripts that you will hear when interacting with Hîsyêô
speakers.

:::info Humanism & Respect

Above all, the Hîsyêô religion is one of human empowerment to do good things in
the world. There is a great respect for all religions as they are primarily
given to us by our upbringing which is the power of family and society. While
this religion doesn't reflect the one acquired from anyone's upbringing, please
provide the same respect to all those who have chosen to participate in Hîsyêô
religious activity.

:::

This faith, centered on the Liberator Collective, believes the universe was
freed from a primordial tyranny of absolute order by a pantheon of anarchist
gods who act as guides, not rulers. Adherents strive to build egalitarian
communities, practice mutual aid, and actively resist the lingering fragments of
hierarchy and control, known as the "Shards of the First Law." Upon death,
spirits are not judged but join a collective spiritual existence called the
Great Weave, where they can remain in community with all who have ever lived or
they may even choose to be born anew into the world.

### Tîengûun
<small>(from the Chinese diety, 天公 tiāngōng)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Tîengûun xe li ôtsôtot yê zomî&emsp;<em>Tîengûun, the God of Society</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

The First Law was a unity of force, not of will. Tîengûun's contribution to the
Shattering was the introduction of *Consensus*. They whispered the first
question into the minds of sapient beings: "What do we want to do *together*?"
This simple idea—that disparate parts could voluntarily align their interests
for a common goal—was a logical paradox that The First Law could not compute.
Tîengûun offered the vision of a society not as a pyramid, but as a network.
Their sacred tools are the ledger of mutual debts of a family or worker council
(the "budget"), the circle of a consensus meeting (the "plan"), and the storage
of goods to prepare for new projects (the "investment"). To follow Tîengûun is
to engage in the hard, rewarding work of collective planning and resource
management for the good of all. Learn more about Tîengûun
[here](/docs/religion/gods/tîêngûun).

### Unonsî
<small>(from the Akan diety, Anansi)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Unonsî xe li ôtsôtot yê kuûnmê&emsp;<em>Unonsî, the God of Technology</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

The First Law dictated that every object had only one purpose: to be a part of
the whole. Unonsî’s act of rebellion was to look at a piece of flint and see
fire. A rock could also be for resting on. A river could carry goods and
messages downstream. They introduced *Potentiality*. Unonsî shattered the Law’s
rigid definitions by creating the first tool, an act that gave sapient beings
the power to reshape their reality. They warn that technology, when touched by a
Shard of the Law, can become a tool of control (surveillance, weaponry), but in
the hands of the free, it is the lever with which a world can be moved. Learn
more about Unonsî here. Learn more about Unonsî [here](/docs/religion/gods/unonsî).

### Suluswutî
<small>(from the Hindu deity, सरस्वती sárasvatī)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Suluswutî xe li ôtsôtot yê kon bêûdo&emsp;<em>Suluswutî, the God of Learning</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

The First Law was a single, inarguable "truth." There was no need for learning,
as everything was already known and fixed. Suluswutî introduced the first
*Question*: "Why?" This simple, corrosive query introduced doubt and curiosity
into a universe of certainty. It was a crack in the foundation of absolute
authority. Suluswutî does not provide answers. Instead, they offer the tools of
critical thinking, the scientific method, and the courage to speak truth to
power. To honor Suluswutî is to teach, to learn, to investigate, and to amplify
the voices of the silenced. They are the patron of the investigative journalist,
the free school, and the endless pursuit of knowledge, not for control, but for
liberation. Learn more about Suluswutî [here](/docs/religion/gods/suluswutî).

### Îfêstôs
<small>(from the Greek diety, Ἥφαιστος Hḗphaistos)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Îfêstôs xe li ôtsôtot yê kon conwêbo&emsp;<em>Îfêstôs, the God of Manufacturing </em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Under The First Law, nothing could be built or unmade outside of the First Law's
program. Îfêstôs’s contribution was the gift of *Labor*. They showed sapient
beings how to take a stone and shape it, to take wood and join it, to take clay
and fire it. They showed that our worlds were not finished products, but raw
materials. Îfêstôs embodies the dignity of work and the power of the creator.
They despise the Shard-influenced idea of wage slavery and the hoarding of the
means of production. Their ethos is that those who build should be the ones who
own and manage, and that the purpose of industry is to create for need and for
beauty, not for profit. Learn more about Îfêstôs
[here](/docs/religion/gods/îfêstôs).

#### Popular Song
Said before beginning a project, or in admiration of a completed work. Each line
is fourteen syllables or seven metrical feet.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>îbûwê bê'ûdo êo. nomû yundô'û.&emsp;<em>The stone teaches. The wood guides.</em></p>

</HisyeoTabs>

### Dimîtu
<small>(from the Greek diety, Δημήτηρ Demeter)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Dimîtu xe li ôtsôtot yê bunxin bûmî&emsp;<em>Dimîtu, the God of Nature</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

The First Law’s "nature" was a perfectly manicured, sterile garden where nothing
ever died or was out of place. Dimîtu’s rebellion was to introduce *Symbiosis*
and *Decay*. They coaxed the first seed to sprout, die, and become soil for the
next, creating a messy, chaotic, and vibrant cycle. This interdependence—the bee
and the flower, the wolf and the elk—was anathema to the Law's singularity of
being. Dimîtu teaches that humanity is a part of nature. They guide sapient
beings in permaculture, in sustainable land use, and in understanding that a
healthy community is a diverse ecosystem. To be influenced by a Shard is to see
land as property to be owned; to walk with Dimîtu is to see it as an ecosystem
to be respected and collaborated with. Learn more about Dimîtu
[here](/docs/religion/gods/dimîtu).

#### Popular Song

</HisyeoTabs>

### Bostet
<small>(from the Egyptian diety, bꜣstt Bastet)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Bostet xe li ôtsôtot yê hondon&emsp;<em>Bostet, the God of Family</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

The First Law knew no individuals, only components. There was no love, grief, or
care. Bostet’s revolutionary act was *Empathy*. They were the first to feel a
pang of sorrow when a part of the whole was damaged, the first to feel a surge
of warmth in communal presence. They introduced the concept of the chosen
family—the bond of affinity and care that goes beyond mere function or blood and
grows with time spent together. Bostet is the patron of the caregiver, the
medic, the parent, and the grief counselor. They teach that a society’s strength
is measured by how it cares for its most vulnerable and how it honors its dead.
They represent the foundational practice of mutual aid, borne from genuine love.
They are the quiet guardian of life's most vulnerable thresholds, the steady
presence at every birth and every death, reminding all that no one has to cross
those lines alone. Learn more about Bostet [here](/docs/religion/gods/bostet).

</HisyeoTabs>

### Kulîôbî
ôtsôtot Kulîôbî xe li ôtsôtot yê foko sunyotnî
Kulîôbî, the God of Entertainment *(from the Greek deity, Κᾰλλῐόπη Kăllĭópē)*

Life under The First Law was utterly without joy. Its purpose was function, not
feeling. Kulîôbî’s rebellion was the first *Laugh*. It was a spontaneous,
useless, and beautiful eruption of noise that served no purpose and followed no
rule. This was followed by the first song, the first game, the first story told
for its own sake. Kulîôbî shattered the Law’s grim utility with the power of
*Play*. They teach that art, sport, and celebration are not frivolous
distractions, but the very purpose of a liberated life. To be touched by a Shard
is to turn art into a commodity and play into a spectacle; to dance with Kulîôbî
is to celebrate freedom itself. Learn more about Kulîôbî
[here](/docs/religion/gods/kulîôbî).

</HisyeoTabs>

### Wicnû
ôtsôtot Wicnû xe li ôtsôtot yê ûsowo
Wicnû, the God of Balance *(from the Hindu diety, विष्णु Vishnu).*

When the First Law was shattered, the raw force of the impact created not just
the Shards (the impulse to dominate), but also Echoes (the pain, trauma, and
misunderstanding that resulted from the violence of the Shattering). Wicnû was
the first to realize that these Echoes would cause sapient beings to harm one
another, mistaking the Echo of the First Law's violence for their own or
another's malice. Wicnû's gift was *Mediation*. The painstaking, patient act of
bringing harmed and harmer together to see the full spectrum of the conflict and
to collaboratively find a path to healing the rupture in the community's fabric.
To engage with Wicnû is to have the courage to face those you have harmed, or
who have harmed you, and to build justice together. Learn more about Wicnû
[here](/docs/religion/gods/wicnû).

#### Popular Song

### Xôcibîlî
<small>(from the Aztec diety, Xōchipilli)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Xôcibîlî xe li ôtsôtot yê hofîn&emsp;<em>Xôcibîlî, the God of Beauty</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

The First Law's greatest tyranny was its erasure of the individual; all were
components, none were persons. Xôcibîlî was the first flicker of self-awareness,
the first being to think "I am." This thought was the ultimate heresy to the
First Law's fascist mandate. Xôcibîlî’s act of liberation was to safeguard the
concept of the unique personality. They champion the "flaws," quirks, and
idiosyncrasies that the First Law would have smoothed away. While Bostet offers
communal care, Xôcibîlî offers the tools for self-care and the courage to define
one's own identity, free from the coercion of both the Shards and the
expectations of the group. They are the patron of the difficult, lonely, and
absolutely essential work of becoming a sovereign individual, without whom a
free society is impossible. Learn more about Xôcibîlî
[here](/docs/religion/gods/xôcibîlî).

### Hûlicîn
<small>(from the Chinese deity, 狐狸精 húlijīng)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>ôtsôtot Hûlicîn xe li ôtsôtot yê hoôs&emsp;<em>Hûlicîn, the God of Entropy</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Hûlicîn was the very first anomaly. They were the initial, inexplicable
**Friction** within the perfect machine of The First Law that allowed the other
nine consciousnesses to spark. They are not intentionally "good" or "bad"; they
are simply an agent of change. Hûlicîn wanders the world, and their footfalls
disrupt patterns. They might topple a carefully planned Tîengûun budget with an
unexpected shortage, forcing a more innovative solution. They might lead a
follower of Suluswutî to a forgotten truth by pure chance. The Shards of the Law
promote rigid, predictable control, making Hûlicîn their natural enemy. They are
the patron of those who leave home without a destination, of the artists who
embrace mistakes, and of the rebels who understand that sometimes the most
powerful plan is to have no plan at all. They are the divine embodiment of the
interesting path, and they promise nothing at the end of it but the journey
itself. Learn more about Hûlicîn [here](/docs/religion/gods/hûlicîn).

</HisyeoTabs>

## Daily Practices

Practitioners of the religion have a special place in their home for personal
spiritual activities. This can include meditation, chants, prayer, singing,
reading scripture, and more. They perform this activity once or twice a day.
Usually after waking up, mid-day, after coming home from work or before bed.
Practitioners can direct these activities towards any, all, or some of the gods.

Additionaly, chants and prayers are said before, during and after group
activities depending on a multitude of different scenarios. For example, a
prayer to Wicnû during a heated argument or a chant to Hûlicîn and Bostet before
heading out on a family adventure.

## Month Names

The Hîsyêô calendar allows the usage of numbered months or there is a set of
religious names. They are made up of the ten gods for the months and they are
organized in alphabetical order. The seond to last month is reserved for
celeberating the Great Weave and then the final month is for planning.
