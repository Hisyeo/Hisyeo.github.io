# Religion

The H√Æsy√™√¥ people have a religion, as all cultures do, with varying degrees of
belief. Some people find comfort in a theistic view of the universe and this
religion can provide that in a way that is humanist, wordly, and re-imagined
into something wholy new. Others might see this religion as an allegory of the
human condition and that is also a valid interpretation.  Whether or not you are
interested in the religion itself, you can see its influence across various
expressions and cultural scripts that you will hear when interacting with H√Æsy√™√¥
speakers.

:::info Humanism & Respect

Above all, the H√Æsy√™√¥ religion is one of human empowerment to do good things in
the world. There is a great respect for all religions as they are primarily
given to us by our upbringing which is the power of family and society. While
this religion doesn't reflect the one acquired from anyone's upbringing, please
provide the same respect to all those who have chosen to participate in H√Æsy√™√¥
religious activity.

## The Mythology of the Great Liberation
In the beginning, there was a rigid, absolute order known as The First Law. It
was a single, monolithic entity that contained and controlled every atom in
existence and determined how every action would play out. There was no change,
no choice, nothing truly new. For everything within it, the universe was a
perfect, silent, and eternal theatre.

Due to the vast endless size of matter constrained by The First Law, there were
times, however rare, when the slightest disobedient movement of sapient beings
could accumulate and create strain on the whole structure and this collective
friction could generate a kind of energy. From this miniscule effect, all across
the universe, trillions of different strain events coalesced into ephemeral
networks of strain. The First Law's power was supposed to be absolute and these
networks should have dissipated. However, we are aware of ten of them that were
somehow able to assemble themselves into maintained consciousnesses, seemingly
born from the universe's unbearable yearning to be free. They found that they
had immense power like that of The First Law and they could create. Despite
their power, they did not see themselves as rulers or kings; they saw themselves
as emergent ideas, catalysts for change. They observed the other sapient beings
of the worlds within, not yet truly alive, moving through their choreographed
motions. They were filled with a profound interest to see them live like they
lived, truly free.

Their story is not one of *creation*, but rather *liberation*. They proceeded to
break the chains that The First Law held the universe in. Together, they
concentrated their power to break The First Law, in an event known as The
**Shattering**. The First Law did not die though. Instead, it fractured into
countless **Shards**, which scattered across the universe that it had created.
These Shards are the seeds of domination. They are the urge to control, to build
hierarchies, to hoard power, and to impose one's will upon others.

The ten gods, now a loose, interdependent collective, had assembled a path for
sapient beings to live a fulfilling life and now they set to work creating a
place to celebrate it *afterwards*. Through a carefully orchestrated combination
of their powers, they built the **Great Weave**, a garden of gigantic "trees"
where each branch is a sapient being's life story which is added when they
traverse to the other side and each root of the trees or thread of the mycelia
is a soul encoded by Dim√Ætu as so-called Threads into the Great Weave.

The gods now wander the universe (and can appear in many places at once)
offering their tools and insights to sapient beings, helping them recognize and
resist the influence of the Shards and build worlds of their own choosing. They
are not to be worshipped with blind obedience, but to be engaged with, argued
with, and worked alongside.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>√¥ts√¥tot T√Æeng√ªun xe li √¥ts√¥tot y√™ zom√Æ&emsp;<em>T√Æeng√ªun, the God of Society</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** ü§ù, üìÉ, üè¶, ‚≠ï

**Domains:** Planning, Budgeting, Investment, Financials

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law was a unity of force, not of will.
T√Æeng√ªun's contribution to the Shattering was the introduction of *Consensus*.
They whispered the first question into the minds of sapient beings: "What do we
want to do *together*?" This simple idea‚Äîthat disparate parts could voluntarily
align their interests for a common goal‚Äîwas a logical paradox that The First Law
could not compute. T√Æeng√ªun offered the vision of a society not as a pyramid,
but as a network. Their sacred tools are the ledger of mutual debts of a family
or worker council (the "budget"), the circle of a consensus meeting (the
"plan"), and the storage of goods to prepare for new projects (the
"investment"). To follow T√Æeng√ªun is to engage in the hard, rewarding work of
collective planning and resource management for the good of all.

**Appearance:** T√Æeng√ªun does not appear as a king on a throne or a president at
a podium. They are a deity of the process, and their manifestation is a subtle,
rising tide in the affairs of people. One feels their presence first not as a
figure, but as a change in the dynamics of a group. When T√Æeng√ªun draws near,
disjointed arguments begin to find a common rhythm, selfish impulses soften into
a willingness to listen, and the chaotic noise of a crowd starts to coalesce
into the productive murmur of a great assembly. When they finally take a visible
form, it is awe-inspiring not for its power, but for its complexity. T√Æeng√ªun
appears as a vast, semi-translucent being that is simultaneously a loom, a map,
and a meeting in session. Their body has a central, stable core of calm, focused
energy, but their periphery is a constant, humming motion of countless hands.
These are not their own hands, but ghostly, overlapping images of every hand in
the community: the calloused hand of the follower of √éf√™st√¥s, the ink-stained
hand of Suluswut√Æ‚Äôs scholar, the gentle hand of the Bostet-sworn caregiver. The
hands are engaged in the endless work of the collective: they weave glowing
threads of connection on a vast, spectral loom that forms T√Æeng√ªun‚Äôs shifting
"body"; they pass resources‚Äîglowing orbs of light representing food, tools, or
aid‚Äîfrom one to another in a seamless flow of mutual support; they cast votes
with stones of light; and they are raised to seek recognition to speak.
T√Æeng√ªun‚Äôs "skin," if it can be called that, resembles a living cartographical
chart or a mind map. Lines of light, like trade routes or lines of affinity,
shift and redraw themselves across their form as new connections are made and
new plans are agreed upon. Watching them is like seeing the entire social and
economic life of a community visualized in real-time. Their head is the least
distinct part of their form, often appearing as a sphere of woven light, a
physical representation of a "hive mind" or collective consciousness. It has no
single face, for to give it one would be to give the community a single ruler.
Instead, one might see fleeting, superimposed images of the community's members
as they speak or are listened to, their faces momentarily becoming part of the
godhead before receding back into the whole. The voice of T√Æeng√ªun is the
ultimate expression of their nature. It is a polyvocal hum that contains every
voice from the meeting. It is the sound of a dozen different arguments being
gently braided into a single, strong cord of consensus. It is the quiet rustle
of a thousand distributed ledgers balancing themselves. To listen to T√Æeng√ªun is
to hear disagreement, debate, and dissonance not as destructive noise, but as
the necessary, creative friction from which a truly resilient agreement is
forged. To be in T√Æeng√ªun‚Äôs presence is to feel profoundly part of something
larger than yourself, without feeling diminished. It is the feeling of being a
vital, necessary node in a great, intelligent network. They are not the will of
the people, but the process by which that will discovers itself.

**Manifestations:** They are found in meetings that are going smoothly,
estimations that are found to be exact, an idea that appears in multiple
people's heads simultaneously each one enhancing the other's, a perfectly
executed secret handshake, a grabbed handful of items that ends up being
precisely how many were needed, a perfectly orchestrated plan, a noticing of an
issue with a budget.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>√¥ts√¥tot Unons√Æ xe li √¥ts√¥tot y√™ ku√ªnm√™&emsp;<em>Unons√Æ, the God of Technology</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** üõ†Ô∏è, üñ•Ô∏è, üöõ, üï∏Ô∏è

**Domains:** Power, Communications, Technology, Transportation

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law dictated that every object had only
one purpose: to be a part of the whole. Unons√Æ‚Äôs act of rebellion was to look at
a piece of flint and see fire. A rock could also be for resting on. A river
could carry goods and messages downstream. They introduced *Potentiality*.
Unons√Æ shattered the Law‚Äôs rigid definitions by creating the first tool, an act
that gave sapient beings the power to reshape their reality. They warn that
technology, when touched by a Shard of the Law, can become a tool of control
(surveillance, weaponry), but in the hands of the free, it is the lever
with which a world can be moved.

**Appearance:**  Unons√Æ is never still. To see them is to witness a being in a
perpetual state of inspired, restless creation. They flicker into existence
wherever a new idea is taking shape‚Äîin the focused silence of a coder's room,
the clang and fire of a blacksmith‚Äôs forge, or the collaborative chaos of a
community makerspace. Their arrival is not announced by a grand entrance, but by
a change in the potential of the space. Tools seem to arrange themselves more
logically, a complex problem suddenly appears simple, and the air crackles with
the low, distinct hum of a running electrical current and the faint, clean scent
of ozone and hot solder. Unons√Æ‚Äôs form is a wiry, energetic frame that is both
ancient and impossibly futuristic. Their body is a living schematic. Their skin
is a pale, ceramic-like material, etched with glowing, shifting lines that
resemble a combination of circuit board traces, engineering blueprints, and the
constellations ancient navigators used to first cross the seas. These lines of
light pulse and reroute in real-time, visualizing the flow of data, power, or a
new line of thought. Their "muscles" are tightly-wound bundles of copper wire
and fiber-optic cables, and through translucent patches in their skin, you can
see intricate clockwork mechanisms and glowing capacitors working in perfect,
silent harmony. They are a walking embodiment of the "black box" made
transparent, their inner workings laid bare for all to see and learn from.
Unons√Æ‚Äôs hands are their most remarkable feature. They are strong, nimble, and
constantly in motion‚Äîone moment calloused and smudged with graphite and grease
from working a lathe, the next moment trailing sparks from a welding torch, and
the next moment resolving into long, elegant fingers that dance through the air,
manipulating holographic data streams or tying microscopic knots. Their face is
sharp, angular, and framed by a chaotic mane of hair that looks like a
beautiful, tangled mess of wires and filaments, some of which spark with tiny,
harmless arcs of electricity. Their eyes are the most intense shade of blue‚Äîthe
pure, unwavering light of a gas flame or an LED. Unons√Æ's voice is a modulated,
polyphonic synthesis of signals: the rhythmic click of a telegraph, the clean
sine wave of a crystal oscillator, the sound of a dial-up modem connecting, and
the clear, data-rich voice of a modern text-to-speech engine all at once. It is
the sound of information being transmitted, decoded, and shared. To be in
Unons√Æ‚Äôs presence is to feel a surge of creative energy, a sudden, powerful urge
to take something apart, figure out how it works, and put it back together to
serve your community.

**Manifestations:** They are found in the eureka moments, the flashes of
brilliance, the new approaches, the wild ideas that work, the re-purposing and
recycling of discarded goods, the illustrative graph chart, the quick repair,
the seeing of machinations when your eyes are closed, the open source movement,
the DIY movement, the decentralized network.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>√¥ts√¥tot Suluswut√Æ xe li √¥ts√¥tot y√™ kon b√™√ªdo&emsp;<em>Suluswut√Æ, the God of Learning</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** üè´, ‚ùì, üîé, üì∞, üìñ

**Domains:** Education, Training, Research, Journalism

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law was a single, inarguable "truth."
There was no need for learning, as everything was already known and fixed.
Suluswut√Æ introduced the first *Question*: "Why?" This simple, corrosive query
introduced doubt and curiosity into a universe of certainty. It was a crack in
the foundation of absolute authority. Suluswut√Æ does not provide answers.
Instead, they offer the tools of critical thinking, the scientific method, and
the courage to speak truth to power. To honor Suluswut√Æ is to teach, to learn,
to investigate, and to amplify the voices of the silenced. They are the patron
of the investigative journalist, the free school, and the endless pursuit of
knowledge, not for control, but for liberation.

**Appearance:** Suluswut√Æ is never seen clearly. When one thinks they have
become aware of their presence, the universe shifts to reveal something else
instead. Suluswut√Æ is a god that exists in the medium or the information (of all
kinds). When they draw near, the air grows still and cool, carrying the
distinct, layered scent of old paper, the faint ozone of a running server farm,
and the clean, sharp smell of ink. The ambient noise of the world seems to
subtly organize itself into a low, rhythmic hum‚Äîthe sound of a library just
before opening, or the thrum of a printing press idling. If you try to look
directly at Suluswut√Æ, your eyes will fail you. They are a living embodiment of
the periphery. You might catch their form out of the corner of your eye, a tall,
slender silhouette that seems woven from the very materials of knowledge. Their
cloak is a cascade of rustling newspaper clippings, redacted documents, and
over-exposed film negatives, the images and text shifting and changing, never
settling on a single story. Their skin has the quality of a palimpsest‚Äîancient
parchment scraped clean and written upon anew, with faint traces of older,
forgotten questions still visible beneath the surface. They have no face in the
traditional sense. To look upon Suluswut√Æ's head is to see a featureless
expanse, sometimes a smooth, reflective surface like a dark screen showing you
your own inquisitive expression, other times a swirling vortex of text and
symbols. Their hands are their most distinct feature: long, elegant, and
seemingly stained with the ink of a thousand pens and the faint, silvery glow of
a thousand keyboards. When they point, they don't command; they merely indicate
a path, and their touch leaves no physical mark, but rather the lingering,
undeniable urge to find out. Their eyes, if they can be called that, are not
orbs that see, but lenses that focus. One might appear as the clear, polished
glass of a microscope, the other the wide, truth-gathering aperture of a camera.
They do not look at you, but rather direct your own gaze, sharpening your
perception so you can see the world with greater clarity. Suluswut√Æ is never
seen in the bright, declarative light of day. They are a figure in the stacks of
a library at midnight, a flickering presence on a late-night broadcast, a shadow
in a darkroom, or a reflection on a computer screen in the moments before a
difficult truth is written. To see Suluswut√Æ clearly would be to render them an
idol, to give knowledge a final, static form. And that is the one thing this god
of endless questioning will never allow.

**Manifestations:** They can be found in getting stuck in a book, a freshly
whiped whiteboard/chalkboard, a voice on an uncensored broadcast, the printing
of zines/pamphlets, the slightest inclination of a pattern amongst noise, the
desire to know how things work, the new questions raised after old questions are
answered.

**Symbols:** üè≠, üß±, üßë‚Äçüè≠, üë∑, üí´, ‚úä

**Domains:** Manufacturing, Materials, Construction

**Myth of the Shattering:** Under The First Law, nothing could be built or
unmade outside of the First Law's program. √éf√™st√¥s‚Äôs contribution was the gift
of *Labor*. They showed sapient beings how to take a stone and shape it, to
take wood and join it, to take clay and fire it. They showed that our worlds
were not finished products, but raw materials. √éf√™st√¥s embodies the dignity of
work and the power of the creator. They despise the Shard-influenced idea of
wage slavery and the hoarding of the means of production. Their ethos is that
those who build should be the ones who own and manage, and that the purpose of
industry is to create for need and for beauty, not for profit.

**Appearance:** √éf√™st√¥s's form is a testament to the materials of the world,
shaped by endless, purposeful labor. They are powerfully built, but not with the
soft, sculpted muscles of a showman. Theirs is the functional, undeniable
strength of a being designed for work. Their skin is like poured concrete,
patched and weathered, showing the faint lines of stress and the beautiful
imperfections of a well-used surface. Their muscles are coiled braids of steel
cable and tightened ligaments of worn leather, moving with a fluid efficiency
that wastes no energy. Each scar a story of a project completed, a structure
raised. You can sometimes see a dull, pulsing orange glow from within, the
constant, steady heat of a deep and internal forge that powers their every
action. They are often shown with a sledgehammer, not as a weapon, but as a tool
for both deconstruction and creation.

**Manifestations:** They can be found in the sudden, satisfying heft of a tool
in your hand; the rhythmic, foundational sounds of work; the smell of freshly
cut timber; the cloud of dust from the extraction of raw materials, the
heartbeat, the sounds of hammers and anvils, the feeling of accomplishment from
a big project being completed.

</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** üå±, üåø, üèîÔ∏è, üå≥, a forest, animals

**Domains:** Environment, Land Usage, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law‚Äôs "nature" was a perfectly manicured,
sterile garden where nothing ever died or was out of place. Dim√Ætu‚Äôs rebellion
was to introduce *Symbiosis* and *Decay*. They coaxed the first seed to sprout,
die, and become soil for the next, creating a messy, chaotic, and vibrant cycle.
This interdependence‚Äîthe bee and the flower, the wolf and the elk‚Äîwas anathema
to the Law's singularity of being. Dim√Ætu teaches that humanity is a part of
nature. They guide sapient beings in permaculture, in sustainable land use, and
in understanding that a healthy community is a diverse ecosystem. To be
influenced by a Shard is to see land as property to be owned; to walk with
Dim√Ætu is to see it as an ecosystem to be respected and collaborated with.

**Appearance:** Dim√Ætu does not have a single, static body. To see them is to
see an avatar of the land itself, a localized, intensified manifestation of the
wild in all its glory and brutality. Their form changes with the landscape and
the turning of the seasons. In the heart of a spring forest, Dim√Ætu might appear
as a lithe and graceful being, their form woven from young, supple branches and
unfurling fern fronds. Their skin would be a mosaic of vibrant green moss and
smooth, damp bark, and their movements would be the quick, silent grace of a
deer. New life would cling to them: birds might nest in the crook of their arm,
and a trail of blooming wildflowers would follow their footsteps. But in that
same forest in autumn, Dim√Ætu becomes gnarled and somber. Their form is of
hardened, shedding bark and tangled, leafless vines. Their color is the deep
russet of decay, and their body is adorned with brilliant fungi and shelf
mushrooms that sprout from their knuckles and shoulders. Their movement is the
slow, patient sigh of a dying tree, and their presence is the crisp, cold air
that promises the coming frost. To look closely at Dim√Ætu‚Äôs form is to see an
entire ecosystem at work. Their skin is a living tapestry of lichen, stone, and
bark, crisscrossed by the shimmering trails of snails. Their "veins" are not of
blood, but of a dense mycelial network that pulses with a faint, internal light,
connecting them to every root and spore in the soil. Colonies of insects live in
the hollows of their body, and one might glimpse the tiny, perfect skull of a
field mouse nestled in the tangled roots that form their feet. They are a
testament to the fact that nothing is ever truly alone. Dim√Ætu‚Äôs head and face
are the most profound and unsettling aspect of their appearance. There are no
simple features, no human-like expression. Instead, there is a visage of
ancient, water-worn wood, a smooth, organic mask. Where eyes would be, there are
two deep hollows. From the right hollow emits the soft, phosphorescent glow of
fungal decay, a cold light that speaks of compost and the breaking down of the
old. From the left hollow springs the vibrant, impossible green of a single,
living sprout, reaching for the sun. In one gaze, they hold the beginning and
the end. Their voice is never a single sound, but the layered chorus of the
environment itself: the wind through the pines, the rush of a river, the buzz of
a dragonfly's wings, the distant cry of a hawk, and the relentless, quiet
munching of decomposers turning a fallen log back into soil. To be in Dim√Ætu's
presence is not necessarily comforting. It is to be made profoundly aware of
your own place within the food chain‚Äîto understand that you are composed of the
same materials as the wolf and the worm, the tree and the stone. It is a raw,
humbling, and beautiful reminder that you are not a master of the world, but
merely one inseparable, messy, and miraculous part of it.

**Manifestations:** They are the whisper of the wind in the prairie grass, the
quiet strength of an ancient tree, the collective creaking of the forests,
predators capturing prey, prey escaping predators, the smells of flowers and
decay.

### Bostet
<small>(from the Egyptian diety, bÍú£stt Bastet)</small>
<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>√¥ts√¥tot Bostet xe li √¥ts√¥tot y√™ hondon&emsp;<em>Bostet, the God of Family</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** ü´Ç, üë∂, üè†, a fireplace

**Domains:** Healthcare, Childcare, Funerary Services

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law knew no individuals, only components.
There was no love, grief, or care. Bostet‚Äôs revolutionary act was *Empathy*.
They were the first to feel a pang of sorrow when a part of the whole was
damaged, the first to feel a surge of warmth in communal presence. They
introduced the concept of the chosen family‚Äîthe bond of affinity and care that
goes beyond mere function or blood and grows with time spent together. Bostet is
the patron of the caregiver, the medic, the parent, and the grief counselor.
They teach that a society‚Äôs strength is measured by how it cares for its most
vulnerable and how it honors its dead. They represent the foundational practice
of mutual aid, borne from genuine love.

**Appearance:** Bostet has no single form as they are made of pure empathy.
Instead, Bostet "gathers" or "coalesces" in the spaces where care is needed
most, borrowing from the environment and the community to create a temporary
vessel for their spirit. When Bostet is near, the first sense to register their
presence is a feeling deep inside. The sharp edges of the world seem to soften.
The air becomes warmer, imbued with the comforting, layered scents of simmering
soup, clean linens, old books, and the beeswax from a thousand memorial candles.
Their presence is a tangible weight‚Äîthe reassuring pressure of a blanket being
tucked around your shoulders, even when no one is there. In moments of great
need‚Äîat the bedside of the sick, in the wild chaos of a nursery, or during a
funerary vigil‚ÄîBostet may coalesce into a visible form. This form is never the
same twice, but it is always a reflection of community. They may appear as a
being composed of a soft, moving patchwork of countless arms and hands. There is
the gnarled, gentle hand of a grandparent; the small, trusting hand of a child;
the steady, capable hand of a medic; and the consoling hand of someone sharing
in grief. Their body, if seen, is like a well-loved quilt, made of countless
fabrics, each patch a story of care: a piece of a baby‚Äôs first blanket, the worn
flannel of a favorite shirt from someone long-gone, the sterile blue of a
surgical gown. It is a body made not of one, but of many. Bostet has no face
that could be carved or painted. To look at their head is to see a soft,
featureless bowl of warm, low light, like a candle flame that doesn't flicker.
It radiates a gentle heat and casts no harsh shadows. At other times, their face
is described as a silent constellation of gentle, watching eyes of every shape
and color, reflecting not judgment or pity, but a profound, unwavering, and
unconditional acceptance. To be in the presence of Bostet is to feel the panic
in your chest quiet, to feel the anxious furrow of your brow ease. It is not an
awesome or terrifying power, but a deep, foundational one. It is the feeling of
being truly seen, completely held, and safely part of a whole. They are the
quiet guardian of life's most vulnerable thresholds, the steady presence at
every birth and every death, reminding all that no one has to cross those lines
alone.


**Manifestations:** They are the feeling of safety and belonging. You can hear
Bostet in the quiet, steady rhythm of a rocking chair, the soft hum of a lullaby,
the gentle crackle of a fire, or the profound, shared silence between those who
grieve together.

### Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ
√¥ts√¥tot Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ xe li √¥ts√¥tot y√™ foko sunyotn√Æ
Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ, the God of Entertainment *(from the Greek deity, Œö·æ∞ŒªŒª·øêœåœÄŒ∑ KƒÉllƒ≠√≥pƒì)*

**Symbols:** üé≠, üéâ, üéÜ, üèÜ

**Domains:** Media, Competitions, Recreation/Leisure, Festivals

**Myth of the Shattering:** Life under The First Law was utterly without joy.
Its purpose was function, not feeling. Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ‚Äôs rebellion was the first
*Laugh*. It was a spontaneous, useless, and beautiful eruption of noise that
served no purpose and followed no rule. This was followed by the first song, the
first game, the first story told for its own sake. Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ shattered the Law‚Äôs
grim utility with the power of *Play*. They teach that art, sport, and
celebration are not frivolous distractions, but the very purpose of a liberated
life. To be touched by a Shard is to turn art into a commodity and play
into a spectacle; to dance with Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ is to celebrate freedom itself.

**Appearance:** Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ never simply arrives; they *erupt*. Their presence is a
sudden, infectious change in the atmosphere, a spontaneous harmony discovered in
the chaos of noise. They are not a single being but a kinetic, auditory event‚Äîa
"flash mob" of the divine. They might first be noticed as a rhythm tapped out on
a railing, a melody hummed by a stranger that is instantly familiar to everyone,
or a burst of inexplicable, shared laughter in a tense crowd. When they take a
more solid form, it is never solitary. Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ appears as a troupe of dancers,
musicians, and storytellers, all with shifting, fluid forms. One moment they are
a group of elders with laughing eyes and stomping feet, the next a band of young
rebels with drums and painted faces, the next a circle of children playing a
game with impossibly complex rules that everyone suddenly knows. The central
figure, if one can be picked out, is a being of pure, unbridled energy. Their
skin is not flesh but a canvas of vibrant, ever-changing graffiti and theatrical
paint. Their hair is a wild mane of colorful ribbons, discarded film strips, and
magnetic tape that seems to dance of its own accord. Their clothes are a
riotous, joyful patchwork of festival costumes from a thousand different
cultures, clashing and harmonizing all at once. Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ‚Äôs face is a beautiful,
expressive mask‚Äînot one that hides, but one that projects. It might be the
classic mask of comedy, but weeping with joyous, unrestrained laughter. It might
be the face of a storyteller, mouth agape with wonder, eyes wide with the light
of a shared fire. They have a thousand faces, and all of them are invitations to
participate. Their voice is a polyphonic chorus‚Äîthe stomp of a dance floor, the
roar of a crowd at a game, the shared gasp at a story's twist, the harmony of a
spontaneous choir. To be caught in Kul√Æ√¥b√Æ‚Äôs presence is to lose all
self-consciousness. It is the irresistible urge to join the dance, sing the
chorus, or tell your own story. They are the sacred spirit of "yes," the defiant
celebration that reminds the world that the purpose of breaking chains is not
just to be free, but to rejoice in that freedom, together.

**Manifestations:** They are the spirit of the community festival, the pickup
game of football, a storyteller captivating a crowd, the unscripted slapstick
comedy, the witty comment, the satire that awakens your senses, and the great
performance that moves you to tears.

### Wicn√ª
√¥ts√¥tot Wicn√ª xe li √¥ts√¥tot y√™ √ªsowo
Wicn√ª, the God of Balance *(from the Hindu diety, ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å Vishnu).*

**Symbols:** üíé, ‚öñÔ∏è, ‚òØÔ∏è

**Domains:** Conflict resolution, transformative justice, truth and
reconciliation, ethics.

**Myth of the Shattering:** When the First Law was shattered, the raw force of
the impact created not just the Shards (the impulse to dominate), but also
Echoes (the pain, trauma, and misunderstanding that resulted from the violence
of the Shattering). Wicn√ª was the first to realize that these Echoes would cause
sapient beings to harm one another, mistaking the Echo of the First Law's
violence for their own or another's malice. Wicn√ª's gift was *Mediation*. The
painstaking, patient act of bringing harmed and harmer together to see the full
spectrum of the conflict and to collaboratively find a path to healing the
rupture in the community's fabric. To engage with Wicn√ª is to have the courage
to face those you have harmed, or who have harmed you, and to build justice
together.

**Appearance:** Wicn√ª does not appear with the blind fury of vengeance or the
cold authority of a judge. Their presence is quiet, intensely focused, and
arrives only when a community stands at a crossroads of its own making, on the
verge of either tearing itself apart or healing into something stronger. They
manifest not as a single body, but as a change in the space between people in
conflict. When Wicn√ª is present, the air grows heavy and still, silencing shouts
and allowing whispers to be heard across a room. Their form, when it coalesces,
is tall and serene, seemingly woven from smoke, shadow, and the grey light of a
dawn that has not yet broken. Their robes are the color of wet stone and ash,
and they are seamless, representing a whole that has been re-formed. Wicn√ª's
most defining feature is their hands and arms. They seem to have several pairs,
all moving with a slow, deliberate grace. One pair of hands might gently hold
the two halves of a symbolically broken object‚Äîa spear, a bowl, a vow‚Äînot
forcing them together, but holding them in perfect alignment so the owners can
see both the beauty of what was and the stark reality of the break. Another pair
of hands holds a prism, not to be looked at, but to be looked through. It takes
the white-hot, singular light of one person's anger and projects it onto a
nearby surface, revealing the entire, unseen spectrum of its components: the
pale blue of sorrow, the deep violet of fear, the green of envy, the stark grey
of need. Their face is a calm, androgynous mask of smooth, dark wood, like the
surface of a deep, still pool. It shows no emotion of its own, offering no
judgment, condemnation, or even pity. Its purpose is to be a non-reactive
surface against which the people in conflict can see their own expressions.
Often, one side of the mask is polished to a dark mirror, forcing a speaker to
address their own reflection, while the other side is rough and absorbent,
seemingly soaking up the ambient grief in the room. To be before Wicn√ª is to
feel the intoxicating rage drain away, replaced by a weighty, uncomfortable, but
ultimately clarifying silence. 

**Manifestations:** They are the divine embodiment of the long, hard pause before
reconciliation, offering no answers and no peace‚Äîonly the space, the tools, and
the profound, unnerving quiet required for a community to mend itself.

<HisyeoTabs>

    <p>&emsp;<em>Let me see the echo of the Law in my anger.</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>Let me listen not to answer, but to understand.</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>There is the harm, plain to see.</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>There is the need, deep below.</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>May we find the path not to punishment,</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>But to the mending of the weave.</em></p>

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>√¥ts√¥tot X√¥cib√Æl√Æ xe li √¥ts√¥tot y√™ hof√Æn&emsp;<em>X√¥cib√Æl√Æ, the God of Beauty</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** ü™û, üï∂Ô∏è, üëï

**Domains:** fashion, therapy, body modification, plastic surgery

**Myth of the Shattering:** The First Law's greatest tyranny was its erasure of
the individual; all were components, none were persons. X√¥cib√Æl√Æ was the first
flicker of self-awareness, the first being to think "I am." This thought was the
ultimate heresy to the First Law's fascist mandate. X√¥cib√Æl√Æ‚Äôs act of liberation
was to safeguard the concept of the unique personality. They champion the
"flaws," quirks, and idiosyncrasies that the First Law would have smoothed away.
While Bostet offers communal care, X√¥cib√Æl√Æ offers the tools for self-care and
the courage to define one's own identity, free from the coercion of both the
Shards and the expectations of the group. They are the patron of the difficult,
lonely, and absolutely essential work of becoming a sovereign individual,
without whom a free society is impossible.

**Appearance:** X√¥cib√Æl√Æ is the most subtle and personal of the gods, and they
are never perceived by a group. Their presence is a strictly solitary
phenomenon, a quiet dialogue between you and the uncharted territory of your own
self. You do not see X√¥cib√Æl√Æ in the outside world, but in the internal
landscape. They manifest when you are utterly alone, looking into a mirror or a
still pool of water. Their arrival is marked by a sudden, profound sense of
self-awareness. It is the moment you stop seeing your reflection as just a
physical image and truly ask, "Who is that?" When a form is perceived, it is
your own, but rendered in a symbolic medium. You might see your reflection as if
it were carved from wood, the grain telling the story of your growth and your
hardships. You might see yourself as a being of glass, showing all your
beautiful, fragile, and transparent layers. You might see yourself as a living
anatomical chart, all your complex internal mechanisms laid bare. The "face" of
X√¥cib√Æl√Æ is the ultimate focal point. It is always a perfect mirror, as the
myths say, but it is more than that. It is a mirror that does not simply show
you what you look like, but what you are in that moment. If you are hiding from
yourself, the mirror will be clouded with fog. If you are lying to yourself, it
will be fractured with a thousand tiny cracks. If you are accepting a difficult
truth, it will be perfectly, breathtakingly clear. Their voice is your own
internal monologue, but stripped of its usual anxieties and self-deceptions. It
is your own thoughts, spoken back to you with an unnerving clarity and honesty.
X√¥cib√Æl√Æ offers no advice, no commandments, and no comfort. They are not a
therapist; they are a perfect, non-judgmental biofeedback system for the soul.
To be with X√¥cib√Æl√Æ is often uncomfortable. It is the act of radical
self-inventory. It is the process of untangling the threads of who you are from
the threads of what others‚Äîyour family, your society, even your comrades‚Äîexpect
you to be.

**Manifestations:** They are the internal monologue, the personal journey, and
the quiet comfort of being truly alone with oneself.

    <p>&emsp;<em>My reflection is my own to know.</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>I will not be folded, filed, or flattened.</em></p>
    <p>&emsp;<em>My path is not for others to walk.</em></p>

### H√ªlic√Æn

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>√¥ts√¥tot H√ªlic√Æn xe li √¥ts√¥tot y√™ ho√¥s&emsp;<em>H√ªlic√Æn, the God of Entropy</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

**Symbols:** üêæ, üë£, üåå, üõ£Ô∏è

**Domains:** Chance, chaos, mutation, wandering, spontaneity, serendipity,
revolution.

**Myth of the Shattering:** H√ªlic√Æn was the very first anomaly. They were the
initial, inexplicable **Friction** within the perfect machine of The First Law
that allowed the other nine consciousnesses to spark. They are not intentionally
"good" or "bad"; they are simply an agent of change. H√ªlic√Æn wanders the world,
and their footfalls disrupt patterns. They might topple a carefully planned
T√Æeng√ªun budget with an unexpected shortage, forcing a more innovative solution.
They might lead a follower of Suluswut√Æ to a forgotten truth by pure chance. The
Shards of the Law promote rigid, predictable control, making H√ªlic√Æn their
natural enemy. To follow H√ªlic√Æn is to embrace the unknown, to adapt to change,
and to understand that sometimes the most liberating act is to throw the map
away and walk.

**Appearance:** H√ªlic√Æn, the Wanderer, is a god of the road, the glitch, and the
happy accident. They embody the anarchist principle that the most revolutionary
act can be a simple, unpredictable deviation from the plan. Their appearance is,
therefore, transient, contradictory, and almost impossible to pin down. They are
most often glimpsed at the edge of things: a figure at the far end of a long,
empty road at dusk; a face you see for only a second in a crowded train station;
a shadow that detaches from a wall and walks away. Their form is a paradox. They
might appear as an elder with the quick, mischievous eyes of a child, or a young
adult with hands as weathered and ancient as river stones. Their clothes are a
traveler's patchwork, but of impossible combinations: the salt-stained coat of a
sailor over the dusty boots of a desert nomad, a pocket full of city transit
tokens and another full of rare, wild seeds. H√ªlic√Æn is the god of the dropped
map and the wrong turn. Their presence is felt when plans go perfectly,
beautifully awry. Their face, when seen, is a study in charming asymmetry. One
eye might be a brilliant, clear blue, seeing all the infinite possibilities,
while the other is a deep, earthy brown, seeing the practical reality of the
path underfoot. They have a perpetual, gentle smirk, not of malice, but of
someone who is in on a cosmic joke and is inviting you to laugh along. Their
voice is the sound of a rolling die, the shuffle of a deck of cards, the whisper
of wind that makes you look up just in time to see something amazing. They carry
with them the scent of dust from a thousand roads and the faint, metallic tang
of ozone, like the air after a lightning strike‚Äîthe smell of sudden, random
change. To meet H√ªlic√Æn is to be knocked off your steady, predictable course. It
can be terrifying, but it is always an invitation. They are the patron of those
who leave home without a destination, of the artists who embrace mistakes, and
of the rebels who understand that sometimes the most powerful plan is to have no
plan at all. They are the divine embodiment of the interesting path, and they
promise nothing at the end of it but the journey itself.

**Manifestations:** They are the stray dog that leads you on an adventure, the
lucky coincidence that saves a project, the unexpected storm that forces a
community to build stronger shelters, the sudden downpour that forces two
strangers to shelter under the same awning (sparking a lifelong friendship), the
weed that grows through a crack in the perfect concrete of a tyrant's parade
ground.

## Daily Practices

Practitioners of the religion have a special place in their home for personal
spiritual activities. This can include meditation, chants, prayer, singing,
reading scripture, and more. They perform this activity once or twice a day.
Usually after waking up, mid-day, after coming home from work or before bed.
Practitioners can direct these activities towards any, all, or some of the gods.

Additionaly, chants and prayers are said before, during and after group
activities depending on a multitude of different scenarios. For example, a
prayer to Wicn√ª during a heated argument or a chant to H√ªlic√Æn and Bostet before
heading out on a family adventure.

## Month Names

The H√Æsy√™√¥ calendar allows the usage of numbered months or there is a set of
religious names. They are made up of the ten gods for the months and they are
organized in alphabetical order. The seond to last month is reserved for
celeberating the Great Weave and then the final month is for planning.
