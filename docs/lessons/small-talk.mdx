# Small Talk

Like all humans, Hîsyêô conversations can sometimes seem to just involve these
details about our lives, our families and the weather.

## How Are You?

The most basic form of small talk is asking how someone is feeling. This shows
the receiver of the question that you are interested in them and their
wellbeing.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>bi zik û nîmû li gô hoî lono ôfo?&emsp;<em>How are you doing today?</em></p>
    <p>oncêmon zik û nîmû hoî îbûdû?&emsp;<em>How are you feeling now?</em></p>
    <p>bi zik û nîmû noî umo Xoônu?&emsp;<em>How are you, Shawna?</em></p>
    <p>nîmû li xôn noî umo Lendun ko.&emsp;<em>Are you okay, Landon?</em></p>
    <p>ujo (li gô) bi zik noî umo Sên?.&emsp;<em>How are things, Zane?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## What Are You Doing?

Another common topic of conversation is what someone is doing, idiomatically
what they are "up to". There are three forms that are a good fit for this question.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>(nîmû) cînlî zik noî umo Donî?&emsp;<em>What are you up to, Donny?</em></p>
    <p>noî umo Lôdolfô (û nîmû) tûu zik?&emsp;<em>Rodolfo, what are you doing?</em></p>
    <p>zik li gô noî umo Kefulin?&emsp;<em>What's happening, Katheryn?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

## Health & Wellness

Often times we also ask if someone is feeling good or tell others about a recent
sickness we experienced.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>nîmû oncêmon zôtêstô (sohoû) hoî lono ôfo noî umo Sokuloyo?&emsp;<em>Are you feeling okay today, Zaccaria?</em></p>
    <p>noî umo Wûon nîmû dôstoc sobûnî ko.&emsp;<em>Juan, did you get sick?</em></p>
    <p>noyo oncêmon yôk xôn noî Nôê.&emsp;<em>I am not feeling well, Noe.</em></p>
    <p>umo Yilî li sobûnî lôîcôk bînê nîo buswen xe nocîdo wêloi hoî lono ôfo.&emsp;<em>Yury is so sick that he had to skip work today.</em></p>
